xxxiv · INTRODUCTION.

temporarias, the personages on whom hs pours out his indignation are
those with whom he and his contemporaries were well acquainted, and
they are those of whom mention is made by Tacitus, Suetonius, the
younger Pliny, and Martial. In the spurious Satires, on the contrary,
which are the work of a Declamator, as Ribbeck calls him, tho few
names which may belong tc contemporaries of Juvenal are with some
exceptione totally unknown. ¹ These Satires alen give us little informa·
tion on manners or events in Rome, while nearly every line of the
genuine Satires contains instructive matter. The Declamator abounds
iu allusione to Greek and Roman history and to mythical legends.
Even Moses is introduced to us. It is true that the writer of the
genuine Satires shows that he was well acquainted with Greek and
Roman history3 but he‘handles his matter like a man of sense, who
knows the world, while the Declamator writes like a pedant

. The Declamator, who tells us little about Rome, treats us with a great
deal about foreign parts, and in the fifteenth Satire he even takes us
into Egypt3 and yet, as Ribbeck maintains, he does not even know that
Canopus (xv. 44, and the note) is in Egypt.

It has been observed also, he adds, that the Declamatcr has a turn for
philosophy, but the genuine Juvenal scarcely indicates any teste for such
speculation. He never uses the word Sapientia, which the Declamator
’ prizes highly, and, following the Stoic doctrine, declares that Nature and
Philosophy teach the same thing (xiii. 189). He seems also to have
collected some of his philosophical matter ‘from other writers3 for
instance, Sat. x. 28, dcc, greatly resembles a passage in Seneca De
Tranquillitate Animi, c. 15, ‘Democritum potius 3' and the matter of a
passage in Sat. x. 346 may have been derived from Valerius Maximus,
vii. 2, Ext. l (see the note on that passage).

From this brief statement the reader may collect the nature of the
general objections to the genuineness of the five Satires which Ribbeck
attributes to an unknown· Declamator. He supports his general con·
clusion by an examination of many passages, and hs employa a chapter
of three-and-seventy well filled peges in belabouring the unfortunate
Declamator, to whom, as far as I have observed, he allows nn merit at
all, not even to the few lines which may he admired by those who do
not value all the Declamator’s poetry. Those who will take the paine
to read Ribbeck’s satirical remarks on the false Satirist‚ will be amused
and instructed, if they shall not be convinced. In fact he has under-
taksn to prove what is often difficult to prove, and sometimes impossible3
to show from a comparison of writings, attributed to the same person,
that some are genuine and some are not. But he evidently has confi·
dence in his own conclusion, and he presses it so hard that he sometimes
misunderstands or affecte ‘not to understand that which others may find
