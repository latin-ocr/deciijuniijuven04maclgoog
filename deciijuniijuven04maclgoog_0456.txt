SATIRA IV.

INTRODUC'I'ION.

russi is not much to remark in this Satire Its purpureis to show that men have
little acquaintance with themselves while they ure rasdy to criticire severely the
characters of their neighbours, aud to take in with delight vulger flsttery. It opens
witha dislogue (if it usn be called so, where one of the persons is only supposed to
utter e desen words put into hia mouth by the other, v. 17, sq.) between Socrates and
Alebisdos, in which the teeoher remonstretes with his fsvourita ou his vuuity und aelf·
oonfidence, just as he does in Platon dialogus, Alcibiades Prior ; hom which some of
the expressions in this scene ure tehen, and the soene itself is evidently copied. This
pert illustratas the llrst point in the Sutire, which is men's ignorenoe of themselves.
'l'heir unkindness to others follows. Yon have only to name e mun, end straightway

tioned. But though meu may hide their sore pleoes from the world and delight them·
solves in flattery, they cannot cheat conscience altogether. 'l'he morel is that meu
should soorn to be called what they ure uot; throw back the flattery of the vulger on
themselvea; and mehe their own breust their home, thet they mey learn how little they

whetO ward of Pericles? No doubt yuu're wisa beyond your years, end so the
people when their passione riae will surely listen to you, saying, ‘citizens Ι tell you
this is wrong—'twerebetterso.’ You oen weigh justice iu the balance, you oen tell
straight from crooked. Yon cannot? 'l’hen es you're only fuir outside, why show
your gaudy teil before your dey to en admiriug crowd? You’re only flt for

conceuls it. Well, try end cheat your conscience if you ean. ‘But ifmy neighbours
preire me shall 1 not believe them θ’ If money turns you pale, if you indulge your
lusts, or if you cheat in the Forum, 'tis vein to drink the flattery of the vulgum
