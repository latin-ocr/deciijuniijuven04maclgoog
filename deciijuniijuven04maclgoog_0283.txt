234 D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Exstantem, et medio sublimem in pulvere Circi

Intunica J ovis, et pictae Sarrana ferentem

Ex humeris aulaea togae, magnaeque coronae

'lantum orbem quanto cervix non sufficit ulla? ac

Quippe tenet sudans hanc publicus et, sibi Consul

Ne placeat, curru servus portatur eodem:

Da nunc et volucrem sceptro quae surgit eburn0,

Illinc cornicines, hinc praecedentia longi

Agminis officia, et niveos adfraena Quirites 45
· Defessa in loculis quos sportula fecit amicos. ’

'I'um quoque materiam risus invenit ad omnes

Occursus hominum, cujus prudentia monstrat

Summos posse viros et magna exempla daturos

Vervecum in patria crassoque suh aere nasci. 50

Ridebat curas nec non et gaudia vulgi,

Interdum et lacrimas, quum Fortunae ipse minaci

Mandaret laqueum mediumque ostenderet unguem.

Ergo supervacua aut perniciosa petuntur,
Propter quae fas est genua incerare deorum. 5⁵
