Pertulit Ionium constanti pectore, quamvis

Mutandum toties esset mare. J usta pericli

Si ratio cst et honesta, timent pavidoque gelantur 9⁵
Pectore nec tremulis possunt insistere plantis:

Fortem animum praestant rebus quas turpiter audent.

Si jubeat conjux, durum est conscendere navem,

Quae moechum sequitur stomacho valet. Illa maritum 100
Convomit: haec inter nautas et prandet et errat

Per puppem et duros gaudet tractare rudentes.

Qua tamen exarsit forma, qua capta juventa

Hippia quid vidit propter quod ludia dici

Sustinuit? nam Sergiolus jam radere guttur 105
Coeperat et secto requiem sperare lacerto:

Praeterea multa in facie deformia, sicut

Attritus galea mediisque in naribus ingens

Gibbus ct acre malum semper stillantis ocelli.
