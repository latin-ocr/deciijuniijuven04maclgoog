as D. suun Juvananr's

Temporibus diris tractanda putabat inermi
J ustitia. Venit et Crispi jucunda senectus,
Cujus erant mores qualis facundia, mite
Ingenium. Maria ac terras populosque regenti
Quis comes utilior, si clade et peste sub illa
Saevitiam damnare et honestum afferre liceret
Consilium? Sed quid violentius aure tyranni,
Cum quo de pluviis aut aestibus aut nimboso
Vere locuturi fatum pendebat amici?
Ille igitur nunquam direxit brachia contra
Torrentem, nec civis erat qui libera posset

Δ Verba animi proferre et vitam impendere vero.

Solstitia, his armis illa quoque tutus in aula.
Proximus ejusdem properabat Acilius aevi
Cum juvene indigno quem mors tam saeva maneret 95
Et Domini gladiis tam festinata: sed olim
Prodigia par est cum nobilitate senectus:
Unde fit, ut malim fraterculus esse Gigantis.
Profuit ergo nihil misero quod cominus ursos
