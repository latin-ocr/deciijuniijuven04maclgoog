A. PERSII FLACCI

Romulidae saturi quid dia poemata narrent.

Hic aliquis cui circum humeros hyacinthina leena est,

Rancidulum quiddam balba de nare locutus,

Phyllidas, Hypsipylae, vatum et plorabile si quid,

aliquae, ac tenero supplantat verba palato. ss

Assensere viri: nunc non cinis ille poetae

Felix? non levior cippus nunc imprimit ossa?

Laudant convivae; nunc non e Manibus illis,

Nunc non e tumulo fortunataque favilla

Nascantur violae? “ Rides,'' ait, “ et nimis uncis 40

Naribus indulges: an erit qui velle recuset

Os populi meruisse, et cedro digna locutus

Linquere nec scombros metuentia earmina nec tus ?”
Quisquis es, o modo quem ex adverso dicere feci,

Non ego cum scribo si forte quid aptius exit, 45
