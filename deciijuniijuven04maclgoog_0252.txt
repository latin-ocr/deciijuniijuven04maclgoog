SATIRA-VIII. 203

Tunc licet a Pico 'numeres genus, altaque si te ‘ '
Nomina delectant, omnem Titanida pugnam

Inter majores ipsumque Promethea ponas:

Nobilitas claramque facem praeferre pudendis.

Omne animi vitium tauto conspectius in se 140
Crimen habet, quanto major qui peccat habetur.

Quo mihi te solitum falsas signare tabellas

Ante triumphalem? quo si nocturnus adulter

Tempora Santonico velas adoperta cucullo? 145
