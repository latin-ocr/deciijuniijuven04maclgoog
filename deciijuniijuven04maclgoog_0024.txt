11.th on JUVENAL. xix

would put his birth, at the earliest, iu the third year of Nero, aa, 50,
and I am inclined to think that this is not fur from the date. [Ribbeck
has come to the same conclusion, Juvenalis Sat. Praefatio.] That he
was familiar with the iniquities of N ero does not certainly prave that
he lived in his reign, and according to the above supposition he was not
more than twelve when Nero died, perhaps less. Of Domitian he writes
with a contempt and loathing which seem to be the fruit of a personal¹
acquaintance with his times, and amemory full of disdain. That he
was of full again Domitian’s reign is certain, since be had formed an
intimate friendship with Martial before the seventh boolr of his Epigrams
was published. That book was written an. 93, and contains two
epigrama, one alluding, and the other addressed, to Juvehal, in terms of
affectionate familiarity. This alone would be sufficient proof that Juvenal
was not exiled by Domitian, at any rate till after the above year, which
was ten years after the death of Paris, and not three years before
Domitian's. In Martial's twelfth book there is an epigram (18) addressed
to Juvenal at Rome, Martial being at his native place, Bibilis in Spain
This epigram was written between the years an. 100 and 104, not long
after the accession of Trajan, and it supposes Juvenal to be wandering
restlessly about the town and tiring himself with attendance on great
pooplo¹ If, therefore, any banishment toolr place in Domitian's time,
the cause could not have been that assigned by the Grammarians, and
it must have been of short duration.

Adopting then such data as ‘appear to have any probability in them,
the following may be laid down as a sketch of Juvenal’s life, without
pretending to accmacy, for which there are no materiale. '

His name was Decius Junius <luvenalis

He was born possibly at Aquinum, in Latium, about the beginning of
Nero's reign, that is soon after nn. 54, of respectable parents, his
raher being a rich libertinus, and he himself therefore ingenuus. He
received the usual education of a Roman boy and youth, as he says (S.
i.15):

“ nt nos ergo manum ferulae subduximus, st nos
Consilium dedimus Sullae privatus ut ultum
Dormiretss’

lie toolr the ‘toga virilis’ about the beginning of Vespasian's reign,
an. 70, and having, as he says above, learnt rhetorio in the schools, he
continued to practise itas a man, not professionally, but for his own
amusement, through the reign of Vespasiae and the greater part of
Domitian's, that is, till the year an. 94, in which year or the next he
by some means offended Domitian, and was sent by him into Egypt
’ witha military command, such as civilians often received during the
Empire. In aa. 96 Domitian was lrilled and Nerva succeedsd him.
