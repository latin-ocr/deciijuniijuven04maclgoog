SATIRA X.

INTRODUCTION.

ἰἰιιιιιιι this satire takes generrd ground, the subject it treats oi is brought home by
exampies aud ιιι mode of treatment to ιιι generation ιιι which it was written. In
this respect ιι well ιι in caustie power, iu brilliancy of lauguages ιιι variety aa weil as
originality, itis superior to the poem written ιιι imitation oi it by Dr Johnson, aud
through whleh it ιι best known to ιιι miq'ority of English readers. Τιι graphio and
(ιιιιιιιιίι passage on ιιι fortunas of Sejanus' is tamely represented by ιιι corresponding
example of Woisey; aad ιιι description oi charles οι· Sweden is a heavy substitute ior
that oi Hannibal. No description of an imbecile old age ever came near that which is
eontained in this satire, and the pietures of Priam's death ιι it might have been and as

¹ it was ars soenes which might be transferred to cauves. The languagc of Nestor at

his sou’s funeral is 'very mournrul. Τιι serious iiues at the end, though the thoughts
‘they eontain ιιι not all original, are iu J uvenal’s best style, which is better than
Horaee's iu dealing with grave subjecta in serious language, as it is ιιι style of a man
in earnest, an impression which Juvenal always conveys, but Horace seldom. 'l'be
relation oi man to Godis truly stated in the words ‘Carior est illis homo quam sihi ς’
and ιιι vigona afa manly heart is excelleutly descdbed in hali a doaen lines, ‘Fortem
posce animum,’ die.
'l'he subject oi ιιι ιιιὶιι is ιιι vanity of human wishes, which are seidom conceived
in a reasonable spirit, and are generally shorts'ighted and impulsiva, ii not in themselves
