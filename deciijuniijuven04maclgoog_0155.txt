SATIRA VI.

INTRODUOTION.

Tffls vigorousaud wonderlirlly copious satire is written in the form of an epistle toa
person named Postumus Umidius, who is about to be married. The poet remonstrates
. with him upon so mad a proceeding, and takes occasion to represent the vices and follies
of women in such colours and under such a variety of forms, as might well stagger a man
who intended tc take a wife from that generation, and appel one who, as he supposes
may bethe case with his friend, had already committed himself to that false step. But
the friend is an imaginary person, and only furnishes the handle for such severe treat-
ment as tha sex has never suffered before or since. The general truth of the picture
Juvenal draws is sufficiently attested by other writers, and may be inferred from tha
honest and genuine tone of the satire itself. Juvenal’s was the heroic age of female ἵ
ι corruption: there were giants ofvice in those days, as there were of passion and exalted ¹
tendemess iu the times of fable and tradition. Messallina was to wantonness what
Medea was to outraged love, and Antigone to a woman’s selfdevotion ; the difference
being that these were the creatione of au exquisite imagination and the embodying ol
a pcet's ideal, while theother went beyond all thet imagination could have conceived or
pects would have venturcd to feign in the realities ofa woman’s daily licentiousness.
The nature of the cxamples Juvenal chooses and the extravagant character of the
times he lived in limit the application of the worst parts of this satire almost to ono
generation. 'l'hough alleges oi reflnement produce female vice and wealrness in aban·
dance, it maybe hoped if Juvenal had lived to expose modern women to themselves and
to tho world, he would, even in the worst days of their dcbauchery and folly, have taken
different ground, and painted his characters in less superhuman proportions; though
Dryden, byapologizing to tbe ludica his contemporaries for translating the satire, leaves
the impression that it is not without its application to them. The chief intercstof the
poem lies in the great powers of language and uncompromising force of indignation that
it displays, and in the historical picture it contains of the manners of the times.
Adultery is the vice with which the poem opens. It is said to have existed before all
others, and to have began when the simplicity of savage life, with its rude freedom from
temptation, gave place to the retinements of civilized society. The· increase of wenlth
and the introduction of foreign manners through the conquesta of Rome, and the idleness Ἴ
of peace, arethe canses to which Juvenal attributes, in common with others, thc j
deterioration of morale and the gradual growth of those stupendcus vices that ho
describes. Eastern impostures and Greek debauchcry very qniclrly took root in tho
soil of Reum and brought forth the fruits of a rampant superstition aad profligare
