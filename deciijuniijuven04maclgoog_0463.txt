414 A. PERSII FLACCI

nese is frequent in Horace, whose language Persius copies in this Satire more even than
in the others. Most of the places are pointed out in the notes.

'lhis poemis ranked by the orities above the other lire. There is not much obscurity
in it, though, according tu the planos this edition, it requires a good many notes. nne

more real. The astrologicnl fictions (of course known by the writer to be so) do not
much detract from this reality, though they would hardly answer the same purpose now. l

he read it. The rest ol' the poem contains so much thetis horrowed inform and len· ξ
