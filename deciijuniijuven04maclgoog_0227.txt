D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Spondet enim Tyrio stlataria purpura fflo.

Et tamen est illis hoc utile: purpura vendit 1³5
Causidicum, vendunt amethystina: convenit illis

Bt strepitu et facie majoris vivere census.

Sed finem impensae non servat prodiga Roma.

Fidimus eloquio? Ciceroni nemo ducentos

Nunc dederit nummos nisi fulserit annulus ingens. 140
Respicit haec primum qui litigat, an tibi servi

Octo, decem comites, an post te sella, togati

Ante pedes. Ideo conducta Paullus agebat

sardonyche, atque ideo pluris quam Cossus agebat,

Quam Basilus. Rara in tenui facundia panno. 145
Quando licet Basilo flentem producere matrem?

Quis bene dicentem Basilum ferat? Accipiat te

Gallia vel potius nutricula causidicorum

Africa, si placuit mercedem imponere linguae.
