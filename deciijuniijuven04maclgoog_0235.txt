D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Institor hibernae tegetis niveique cadumi,

Dummodo non pereat mediae quod noctis ab hora
Sedisti qua nemo faber, qua nemo sederet

Qui docet obliquo lanam deducere ferm3 ,
Dummodo non pereat totidem olfecisse lucernas 225
Quot stabant pueri, quum totus decolorasset

Flaccus et haereret nigro fuligo Mamni.

Rara tamen meroes qnae cognitione tribuni

Non egeat. Sed vos saevas imponite leges,

Ut praeceptori verborum regula constet,

Ut legat historias, auctores nouerit omnes,

Tanquam ungues digitosque suos 3 ut forte rogatus,
