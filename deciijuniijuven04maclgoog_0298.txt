SATIRA X.

Ad Phialen: tantum artificis valet halitus oris,

Quod steterat multis in carcere fornicis annia.

Ut vigeant sensus animi, ducenda tamen sunt aro
Funera natorum, rogus aspiciendus amatae

Conjugis et fratris plenaeque sororibus urnae.

Haec data poena diu viventibus, ut renovata

Semper clade domus multis in luctibus inque

Perpetuo moerore et nigra veste senescant. 215

Exemplum vitae fuit a cornice secundae.

Distulit atque suos jam dextra computat annos

Quique novum toties mustum bibit. Oro parumper 250
