surum XI. 259

your purae will go no further than a gndgeon. What can yon come ιο ir' your eppe·
t'rte grem larger as your pnrse grows emptier3 when all yon have is bnried in your
bully? 'l'be ring goes last and Pollio with bare finger begs. Wantonness leurs not
early death, bnt age mneh worse than daath. 'lhe steps are these. Money is bor·
rowed first and spent at Rome 3 but when the usurer begins to trouble them, then
off they go to some nice country town. '1¹0 run away from the forum is no worse
than fromSubnrra ιο migrate to Esquiliae: they only esre that they must lose the
games: they never thinkof blushing: Modesty is langhed at as she dias the town,
and few men esre to stay her. ’

V. 56. 'lo-day, my friend, yon’ll see whether 1 practise what Ipreach, or praise plain
fare bnt call for rich. Yuu’ll find in me Itvander, yon shall be Hercules or Aeneas.
Now listen to your dinner. A young lid from my farm, and wild roots gathered by
my gardener's wife 3 fresh egge warm ln the nest, and heus that laid them3 grapes
fresh aa when first plnclred, the duest pears and apples, the crude juiue dried hom
ont them.

V. 77. Such was the dinner of our senators when first they grew luxurians. 'lhe herbs
he gathered in his little garden‚ such aa a ditcher now turns up his noae at, Curius
would boil with his own hund. 'lhe flitch hung up to dry in former times they kept
for holidays, and lard for birthdays for their blood relations and part of the victim's
meat. 'Ibe great man who had thrice been consul, dictator too, went to such feasts
stalhing along with spade upon his shoulder. In the strict Censor's days no one
would ask what sort of turtles might -be found in the sea, to ornament the rich man's
conch ε they were content with a rude ass’s head. Their food and house und furni·

Δ ture were plain alihe.

V. 100. Unslrilled in art, the cupa they got for plunder the soldiers broke ιο ornament
their harneas or their helmets. 'l'he only silver that they had adorned their arms.
Their homely fare was served in earthenware. Il you’re inclined to emy, you might
envy those good times. The gods were ncarer unto men 3 they warned the city of
the Gauls’ approach, such oure for Rome had J opiter when made of clay. The tables

⁴ then were made of bomegrown wood„ But now the richeat riands have no flavour
except on a round table with a carved ivory stem 3 a silver one to them is rude as uu
iron ring upon the finger.

V. 129. l'll have no guest then who despises porerty. I have not an onnce of ivery in

sll my house 3 the very handlea of my knivea ure bone3 and yet they do not spoil the ’

meat, or cut the worse for that. And I've no carver taught by first-rate artist, who
teaches them to cut np all fine dishes. My man’s a novica too, and cannot fllch
except in a small way, a chop or so. I’ve only a rough boy in woollen clothes ιο
offer you my vulgar herba, no eastern bought for a vast price frum dealers. Whatever
yon may ask for ask in Latin. 'lbey all ere dressed alike, their hair cropped straight,
combed out toduy in honour of my guest3 boys from ‘the farm, modest as those
should be who wear the purple, not trained to lewenses, One shall bring you wine
grown on his native bills. Loolr not for wunton dancing girls (such as your married
ludiesgaze at with their husbands at their elbow) to tickle lust: though women care for
this more than the men. But this is not for humble honses. We leave the click of
melanem and songs too lewd for brothels and all the trichs cs lust for those who void
their rheam on marble fluore. We malie ullowances for wealtb, only the poor are
ehamed by gambling and adultery: the rich who do such things are marry gentle·
men. You'll flnd with me a different sort of sports: we'll read what Homer wrote
’ and his peer Maro. It matters not what voice recites such verses.

V. 183. But come, put care away und take a rest. We’ll heve uo word οι dehts or
jealous thoughts3 before my door yon must put off all this, honre end its troubles,
slaves and their brealrages, and worse than all the ingratitudo of friends. 'lhe grem
