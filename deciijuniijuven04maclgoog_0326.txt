. SATIRA XII.

INTRODUCTION.

ans is a letter to a friend who is named Corvinus, explaining to him the reasonof the
poet’s rejoicing on a particular occlasion, which proves to be the saie arrival of his friend
Catullus, alter a stormy voyage in which hehad enoonntered the usual dangers and dis·
played the usual amount oi ferr. 'l'here is some playfnlness‚ though perhaps a little
ponderous, in the description of his frieud's conduct and sufferings; but the whole oom-
position cannot bave cost the writer much labour, aud does not offer much entertaiument.
The last thirty or forty lines are occupied with e stroke at legacybunters, whom Horace
handles so severely (particularly in S. ii. 5). This professes to be introduced lest Corvinus
should suppose all this enthusiasm for Catullus' safety was pretended with an eye to bis
will. The short answer to this is that the man has three children, and that uo one
would think it worth his while to spend the worth of an old hen dying of pip upon a
man so situated, if his only object was to be remembered in his will. This is the only
part of the poem that belongs properly to satire, and it is only a side-blow.
