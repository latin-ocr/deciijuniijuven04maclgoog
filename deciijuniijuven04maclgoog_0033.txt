'xxviii '⁷ INTRODUCTION.

The Grammarian says he reverenced as a father Servilius Nonianus,
who was probably 1 friend of his own father. His praenomen was Marcus.
He was consul the year after Persius was born, and died two years before
him. He was distinguished as 1 public speaker and 11 an historiari, and
likewise for the purity 01 his life, as Tacitus says ². The Scholiast says
that Persius’ honest friend, Macrinus (Plotius, the Scholiast calls him),
to whom the second Satira is addressed, lived with Servilius, and so
perhaps the intimacy between these friends began.

Among his 'fellow-pupils was M. Annaeus Lucanus, author 01 the
Pharsalia, a young man 01 great abilities, whose career, like that of
Persius, was short. He was about the same age as Persius when they
,were studying together, and survived him not more than three years.
He was put 10 death 101 joining the conspiracy of Piso against Nero,
Aa). 65 ⁸. Jahn takes paine to show that there could be no great sym-
pathy between the impetuous Spaniard and the quiet modest Persius;
⁶ but very opposite characters are drawn into intimacy by circumstances
and by particular points 01 mutual attraction. Lucanus praised the
poetry 01 Persius with every appearance 01 sincerity, and that would be
a virtue in his or any author's eyes.

It was, no doubt, through Cornutus or Lucanus that Persius became
acquainted with another 01 the Annaei, M. Seneca, uncle 01 Lucanus.
This acquaintance did not begin so soon as the others, and Persius was
old enough 10 form a deliberate judgment of Seneca’s character, and
according 10 the Grammarian it was 1101 favourable to him. That
Seneca’s connexion with Nero led him into acts at varianoe with his
professed principles, is certain, and there is no reason to suppose
that Persius entertained 1 warm affection foreman forty years older
than himself, associated, with or without his own free will, with the
,crime of a matricide, and whose enormous wealth was chiefly accu-
mulated through the favour of a tyrant whom Persius despised and
abhorred. But the remark 01 the Grammarian seems to be that 01
one who had himself adopted the exaggerated opinion against Seneca,
which the jealousy of his rivals and enemies gave rise to during his
life ⁹.

Of the young men whom the Grammarian describes in such high terms,
.' Claudius Agathemerus and Petronius Aristocrates, nothing is known.

⁸ See 11011011 J uv. vii. 79. The age usually assigned to Lucanus at hisdesth, twenty·
six, cen hardly be right. The Grammarian says he was of the same age as Persius, and
he could not have been much younger, 01 1111 than thirty, in ,1.11. 65. [The Gramma·

rian's words 111 ‘aequaevum auditorem,' which perhaps need not be taken very strictly.
The evidence for Lucan's age at the time of his death is very small]

⁹ The character of the younger Seneca, as aman and a writer,is temperatsly reviewed
in Μ1. Long’s notice of him in the'Dictionary of Biogrnphy.
