xvi INTRODUCTION.

Hadrian suceeeded Trajan in an. 117, and there is an allusion to the
silence of the oracle of Delphi in vi. 555, which makes it appear that the
Satire was written before the reign of Hadrian, or at its commencement,
for he restored that oracle which Nero had stopped. This probably
took place during Hadrian’s residence at Athens, an. 123-126.

It is not certain in what years of his reign Hadrian ereeted the mag·
nificent palace near Tibur, of which the ruins still exist 3 probably not

before an. 134. But it is certain it was not built when Juvenal wrote
his fourteenth Satira, or he would have referred to it among the build-
ings he names vv. 86-91.

But the seventh Satira, which has beenthe subjectof so much disputa,
appears to me to bear the strongest internal evidence of having been

’ written ιιι Hadrian’sreign. He was an author himself, and the patron

of authors, and Juvenal could not have said this of any of the other
emperors that preceded him without egregious dattery, of which he was
incapable. The statement of the Scholiast that in that Satira “Nero-
nem palpat '' is not worthy of notice.

The fifteenth Satire turns upon an event said to have happened ’
“nuper Consule Junio '’ (v. 27) i. It may not be possible to say with
certainty which consul Junius he refers to. But my own opinion, and ,
that of many others, is, that it was Junius Rusticus who was consul in ’
A..1› 119, the second year of Hadrian’s reign. Ι cannot doubt that m
this Satire Juvenal refers to his own experienee of Egypt during a resi·
dence there ιιι former years Heinrich's pupil, Francke, has taken χ
great pains to show that Juvenal had never been m Egypt But he 1s 3
obliged to get rid of so many verses as spurious which Ι believe to be as
genuine as any in the Satira, that his arguments are of no value in my
opinion. It is possible Juvenal may have been iu Egypt before Aa). 84,
when the only other Junius, Appius Junius Sabinus, was consul, that
being the third year of Domitian’s reign. In that case the whole story
>of his exile by Domitian becomes a fable, as the details of it manifestly
are, unless it be said that the Satire was written in Egypt, or, if written
at Rome, that the poet had been recalled hy the emperor who sent him

t Jahn and O. F. Hermann, in their editions, hare adopted the variant Junco for
Junio, from Pithoeus' MS. Hermann, in his Dissertation on the seventh satire
(Gettingen, 184³), takes Junius Rusticus for the consul, but in the preface to his
edition (1854) he argues for J uncus, who, he says, was Consul Suffectus an. 127. I
adhere to J nnius t but Hermann’a date, whichis eight years later, would not materially
effect the view 1 take of the poet's career. J uncus does not appear in the Fasti till
an. 182, and Hermann, in hia Dissertation, doubts the existence of an earlier J unone:
“Siquidem iuncum consulem, si qnia unquam fut, nou novimus ante a. 127 p. cn.
quo suffectos certe S. Julium Jnncum, Man. Vibium Servium nuper demum clem.
Cardinalis in Actis dead. Rom. Arohaeol. leet, Τ. vi. p. 240 probare conatus eat,'’
