SATIRA VIII.

Roma Patrem Patriae Ciceronem libera dixit,

Arpinas alius Volscorum in monte solebat

Nodosam post haec frangebat vertice vitem,

Si lentus pigra muniret castra dolabra.

Hic tamen et Cimbros et summa pericula rerum

Excipit, et solus trepidantem protegit Urbem, 250

Atque ideo, postquam ad Cimbros stragemque volabant
Qui nunquam attigerant majora caderem corvi,
Nobilis ornatur lauro collega secunda.
