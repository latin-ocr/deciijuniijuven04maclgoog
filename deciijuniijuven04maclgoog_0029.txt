xxiv INTRODUCTION.

LIFE OF PERSIUS.

'Tne principal facts of Persius' life may be gathered from a memoir of
'which the following is a translation. The author, by some supposed to
‘be Suetonius, cannot be conjectured with probability. It appears in
*most of the old MSS. of Persius, and in some of the oldest is said to be
extracted from a commentary of Valerius Probus. That name is given
to other memoirs besides this, and whether it represents one, or two, or
Δ several early Grammarians, is uncertain. There is no doubt however
that the account is very old, and the statements have an air of· truth
which is confirmed by internal evidence. There is little in Persius’
writings on which to construet an imaginary biography, and this is so
far a guarantee for the genuineness of this Grammarian’s facts. '
“Aulus Persius Flaccus was born the day before the nones of December,
in the consulship of Fabius Persicus and L. Vitellius ¹. He -died the
'eighth day before the kalends of December, in the consulship of P.
Marius and Asinius Gallus¹. He was born [in Etruria⁸], at Volaterrae,
a Roman eques, by blood and marriage connected with men of the
highest rank. He died at the eighth milestone on the Appian road, on
his own estam. His father Flaccus left him a minor, about six years
old. His mother Fulvia Sisennia afterwards married Fusius, a Roman
eques, and him too she buried within a few years. Flaccus pursned his
studies until his twelfth year at Volaterrae; after that at Rome with
“ the grammarian Remmius Palaemon, and the rhetorician Virginius
Flavus ⁴. When he was sixteen years old he first began to enjoy the¹
-friendship of Annaeus Cornutus, to whom he became so much attached
that he never left him, and by him he was initiated to a certain extent,
iu philosophy. He had for his friends from his earliest youth, Caesius
Bassus, and Calpurnius Sura ⁶, who died young during Persius’ lifetime.
