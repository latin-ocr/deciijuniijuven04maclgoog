no difficulty about. So 101 00 1110 Ι admit: he has proved clearly
enough that there 010 very manifest differences between thematter and
110 style 01 110 100 Satires which he aenigne to Juvenal, and the five
which he has handled so unmeroifully. These five Satires are matred
by great faults, and oontain comparatively few good lines. They 010
indeed feeble compositione 00 satiras, when compared with 110 vigorous
work of the earlier pieces, the best 01 which 010 perhaps 11000 which
cannot be read with young men. If any Satira 01 110 five is 10 be
excepted from this general condemnation, it 10 110 thirteenth; but many
00110 even 01 1101 Satira are open to just censure. As 10 110 famous
tenth, if we do not except 10110 matter, we may allow that 11010 10
some merit in the manner in which the subject is treated; but even if
this admission is made, it is still nothing 111010 1100 0 frothy declama-
1100. Βο11 110 matter and the style of the tenth form 0 striking eontrast
to another Satira, the third, which is justly admired. It is a living
picture.

The question then is, whether the same man wrote 01 could write all
these Satires, a question which Ribbeck answers by affirming that he
could not ; and he labours hard 10 prove his assertion. But it is im-
possible 10 say what a man may do 10 110 way of writing, for the same
men have written wisc books and foolish books, bad poetry and good
poetry. The same difficulty existe 00 10 00100 01 Cicero's orations,

which are so bad that some excellent critics maintein 1101 Cicero .

could not have written them 3 buton the other hand there 010 0111100,
both old and new,›wh0 admisu the spurious orations, and think they 010
very fine. '

As to the sixteenth Satire, which is manifestly 0 fragment, it 10
admitted by Ribbeck that this may be 0 01000 01 110 1100 Juvenal’s
work. , ,

10 a second chapter Ribbeck discusses the interpolatione in the 100
Satires. His hypothesis, he says, about the five Declamations would
1010 badly, if we accepted the ten Satires in their present form as the
genuine work 01 Juvenal; for all the faults which have led him to
reject the five Declamations, are found here end« there in the 100
Satires ς and these bits of patchwork resemble so much the whole texture
of the five Declamations, that if we allow them 10 010οᾶ where they
010, we must admit that the poet could exhibit in 110 00010 Satirethe
skill of a master and the stupidity of a bungler. However, there is 00
necessity, he says, 101 1110 admission, 101 110 100 Satires are dis·
figured by interpolatione which heve been remarked on by many recent
critics; and indeed nobody who has read Juvenal with any care will
deny that there 010 1010100101οἀ verses. Ribbeck has only increased the
number 01 11010. Τ1010 010 two long passages, which Ribbeck assumes
