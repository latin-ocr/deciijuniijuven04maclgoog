SATIRA XI.

Idem habitus cunctis, tonsi rectique capilli

Atque hodie tantum propter convivia pexi.

Pastoris duri est hic filius, ille bubulci:

Suspirat longo non visam tempore matrem

Et casulam et notos tristis desiderat haedos,

Ingenui vultus puer ingenuique pudoris,

Quales esse decet quos ardens purpura vestit: 155

Nec pugillares defert in balnea raucus
Testiculos, nec vellendas jam praebuit alas,

Cressa nec opposito pavidus tegit inguina gutto.

Hic tibi vina dabit diffusa in montibus illis

Aquibus ipse venit, quorum sub vertice lusit: 160
Namque una atque eadem est vini patria atque ministri.
Forsitan exspectes nt Gaditana canoro
