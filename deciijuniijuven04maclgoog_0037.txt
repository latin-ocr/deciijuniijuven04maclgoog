xxxii INTRODUOTION:

been supposed to represent the handsome features attributed to Persius,
but they may be any body, and we must be content with the Gram-
marian's testimony to his beauty.

Tua publishers of this edition of Juvenal and Persius, having deter-
mined to reprint the book, asked me to correct the sheets. Though very
busy about other things, Icould not refuse to perform this slight service
for the work of my departed friend. It is tome a cause of great regret
that Mr. Maeleane did not live to revise this volume. His testes and·
his abilities particularly qualified him to be an editor of'Juvenal and
Persius3 and as a first edition of such a book must be imperfect, he
would certainly have improved it, if he had lived long enough. His

knowledge of the world, his strong sense, quick perception, and sound ’

judgment, applied to a second edition, might have produced a work that
would have satisfied the readers of Juvenal and Persius for some time.
What he has done however is well worth preserving‚ and I believe that
future editors—and in due time they will appear,—-may find iu the Intro·
ductions,A1·guments, and Notas, much matter that will help them towards
the meaning of the Satirists. Ido not think that Mr. Macleane has
often missed the sense of his authors, and he has certainly sei'zed

it sometimes where other editors have not. He possessed one qualityin ἵ

a striking degree—a bold and independent judgment, without which an
editoris in danger of being confissed and misled by a great variety of
opinions. His notes show the character of his mind. He often exe
presses his opinion very positively‚ and sometimes perhaps in away that
,may offend3 but he had a sincere'reepect for good sense and sound
knowledge in others; he had none of the feeble conceit which often goet'
with what is termed learning, and he had some reason to feel confideret
in hia own judgment, for few men were so quick in detecting au
absurdity or went so straight to the meaning of a thing. The intro·
duction to the thirteenth Satine of Juvenal is an evidence of his large
and liberal views on a subject on which many who belong to his profes·
sion, and even others who·d0 not, have uttcred and ‚still utter their
wretched commonplaces.

I have not altered the text of this edition, and in only a few l

places the punctuation. Ihave added a collation of thia text oi
Juvenal with that of Jahn, whose asehl edition is now generally
