D.'JUN11 JUVENALIS

Ergo hic praecipuum summumque meretur honorem,
Qui grege linigero circumdatus et grege calvo
Plangentis populi currit derisor Anubis.
Ille petit veniam, quoties non abstinet uxor 535
Concubitu sacris observandisque diebus,
Magnaque debetur violato poena cadurco,
Et movisse caput visa est argentea serpens:
Illius lacrimae meditataque murmura praestant
Ut veniam culpae non abnuat ansere magno 540
Scilicet et tenui popano corruptus Osiris.

Quum dedit ille locum, cophino foenoque relicto
Arcenam J udaea tremens mendicat in aurern,
Interpres legum Solymarum et magna sacerdos
Arboris ac summi fida internuntia caeli; 545
Implet et illa manum, sed parcius: aere minuto
Quahaeunque voles J udaei somnia vendunt.

Spondet amatorem tenerum vel divitis orbi
Testamentum ingens calidae pulmone columbae
