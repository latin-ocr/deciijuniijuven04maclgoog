scholar. It has been lately republished by Duebner (Leipzig, 1839),
with the text revised but not improved by this editor, who has
added to Casaubon’s notes the conflicting opinions of other com-
mentators. 'Phe notes of Lubinus are so wordy and embarrassed
as to be quite unreadahle. Plum and Koenig have furnished the
world with long commentaries, of which Plum’s is the better. Pas·
sow’s edition (Leipzig, 1809) is accompanied by a German trans-
lation, and a commentary in the same language 011 the first Satirc.
In cases ol 'difficulty I have not been able to rely upon his judg-
ment. Orelli has given the text, scholia, and many ol the various
readings ol Persius in his Eclogae Poetarum Latinorum. His text
isgood, and I have never failed to consider it with respect. Every
editor who thinks as he ought, independently, will have his own
opinion of his author’s meaning, and so will choose, out of many
that may have authority, that reading which best represents his
1 opinion. With this remark I disclaim any want of proper deferenee
to the scholarship of others more learned than myself. Scholarship
(of a certain sort) and learning do not always go along with judg-

ment 3 sometimes theytend to obscure it ς nor are all editors
learned that contrive to seem so.

'Phe scholia on this author, published with great care by Jahn,
are more numerous than those ·on Juvenal. They passed among
scholam of the early time as the productiori of one person, and he
no other than Annaeus Cornutus, the teacher of Persius. It does
not require much discrimination to see that they are not from that
source, and do not contain a syllable that was written near the time
of the poet. Jahn has taken great pains to show that they are the
work of a later Cornutus of the tenth century, who wrote a com·
mentary also on J uvenal. If this be so, he may have used notes of
earlier Grammarians than himself without acknowledgment. There
is a great deal of useful and a great deal of foolish matter in these
scholia.

Of the MSS. of Persius Jahn has mentioned and described sixty-
seven, of which the most memorable are a fragment ol the first
Satire, edited by Mai from the famous Vatican Palimpsest, and
two others of the ninth and tenth centuries which bear an inscrip-
