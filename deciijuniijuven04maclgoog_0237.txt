D. JUNII IUVENALIS

SATIRA VIII.

INTRODUO'IION.

'lna vice of aristocratic pretension is here represented with moderaticn and good sense.
'l'here is uc idle declamation against hereditat-y honours, hut the blindness 61111611
belonging te an exclusive class, whose claims to distinction were founded upon the
merite of the great and good of former generations and unsupported hy any personui
merita of their own, is shown in lunguage which no 6116 can object tc, and reasoniug
which admits of no answer. The nobility of a man’s ancestors, 116 says, only holds a
torch up te his shame if 116 live unworthily of them. 'l'he more exalted is the guilty,
themora conspicuous is his gnilt. The only true nohility is virtue, and the virtuons
nobleman is a nobleman indeed. 'l'hc racc-horse, if 116 show no signs of his descent, is
setta grind or draw a cart. Among the despised plebeians there are those who have
great gitta and virtues, and have rendered great services to the nohility and to their
country. These are the commonplaces of the Satira, which also exposes some of the
particular vices among the patricians of the day, among which were gamhling‚ heeping
low companyat tavernas passion for driving and for the stahles, acting in public,
hiring themselves for gladiatore 3 hut above all gross maladmiuistration in the
provinces, against which Juvenal takes pains to cantion his friend, Ponticus, to whom
the Satira is addressed in the form of an Epistle. He 16611661 the class against
whose degenerata members the Satine is directed; and we may suppose he was 6
young man with what we should call good prospecte. I think a real person must
have been meant, and that the poem is not 6 mere declamation. Heinrich inquires
whether the subject was suggested by real life or the rhetorical schools, aud thinks
the poem was drawn from both sources. There was enough in real life to suggest
it, as there would he still and perhaps more; aud we need not,1 thinlr, go 16 the
schools for its inspiration. The pride of birth and the degeneracy of iuherited nobility
were not new features of society in Juvenal's time, and they have not grown so old
in curs hut that generations to come will complain aa he did, and pour contempt,
as he did not, ou the iuheritance of noble names, however virtuosa their possessore
may he.

’111616 are some severe lines on the Emperor Nero (all-226), aud the Satira was
’ written al'ser his tima, as the context shows ; hut how long it is impossible to say.

ARGUMENT.

What nse are pedigrecs‚ 6116661161 blood, statues and images, and noble 11611166, if in
1116116661 our great ancastcrs we live omiss-gamhling all night and going to hed
at dawn, when they were up aud menching? What joy has Fabius of 1116
Allobroges’ victor, ol the great altar, of his desceut from Hercules, if hehe covetous
6 scol, effeminate, if he bring shame on his rough ancestors, turn poisoner, and
disgraca his house? Line your whole house with imeges, yet still virtue aloneis 11116
nohility. Be Paullus, Cossus Drusus in your morale, and give them place before your
irreges, ay, and your own lictors 166. First 1 claim the gocduess of your beart: be
holy, just, in word and deed, and then 1 count yon noble Hail, Gaetulicus, or what·
666161616611 yon come hom, your country may be prond of you, and all may cry as
they do who have ⁸found Osiris. What man is generensis 116 be unworthy of hia
raca, illustrious only for his name? We call a dwarf an Atlas, an Aethiop a swan,
