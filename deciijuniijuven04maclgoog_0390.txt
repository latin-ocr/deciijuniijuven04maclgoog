SATIRA XV.

INTRODUOTION.

ans satire must have been written after J uveual's residence iu Egypt. Under what
circumstances he weutto that country there is not sufficient authority for sayiugwitb any
certainty. In v. 27 there is an allusion which gives fair ground for supposing that the
poem was written in the reign of Hadrian (ses note). It turns upon a case saidto bave
happened not long before. The people oi Ombi (v.¹ 85), a town in Upper Egypt, wor-
shipped the crocodilo, while those of Tentyra (nearly a hundred miles lower down the
Nile) were opposedtothat worship, aud were particularly distinguished for their skill and
courage iu killing the crocodile. This caused a feud between the two peoples, and while
the Ombites were celebrating a religione festival the Tentyrites came aud attached them.
The Ombites were put to ssight, aud the Tentyrites are represented as having caught one
of them aud in their fury having eatan him up. This story gives occasion fora good deal
of strong contemptuous writing against the Egyptians, their religion aud morale, a vivid
description of the above ravage scene, set off by some tine lines on the more tendet
instincta of human nature, and thetios of sympathy that unite mankind Theprincipal
subject is revolting, aud it was not possible to malso it oneof general interest. It seems
as if the story, whether true or not, had -been repeated to Juvenal and had called up all
the prejudioes a resideres among these ¹people had created in his mind, His power in
sketching soenes from real life has been seen iu the course of these satiras, and bere we
have a picture on a larger scale dmm with a strong aud rough hand, such as nearly all
his picturas show.

The Satire is addressed tc Volusius Bithynicus, whoerer be may have been. Perhaps
heisnomorethananame. ’
