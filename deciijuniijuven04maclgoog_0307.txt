SATIRA XI.

INTRODUOTION.

Jnvnm invites his friend, whom 110 calls Persicus, to dinner, and prepares him for
plain fare by observatione on the conduct of those who with small means affectthe
indulgenoas of tha rich, and who sqnander the little they have upon their belly. This
extravagance he associatos with aelf-ignoranoe, and takes occasion to commend that

goldcn rulo of life, Kaow 11110111. He givesasimple account of his own table and ¹

establishment, comparing his own way of living with that of the worthies efformet
days, and contrasting it with the display and protusion of modern times, in respect to
farnitum, servants, and foedas well as the wanton entertainments with which the
fashionable dinners of his day were accompanied.

The time is that of the Megalesion festival in honour of Cybele, that is in April, and

Juvenal was not young when he wrote. The compositionis in Horace's style, without 1

any appearance of imitation. The subject is not large, and there isne great variety ot
treatment. But aaa picture of domestic manners and of a household of the better sort
the satire is pleasing. If further historica] evidence were needed than is abundantly
found elsewhere in respect to the sslf-indulgenccof the rich and their way of living,this
satire would supply it. 'l'he principul oommonplaoe is sensibly put the simplicity oi
the oldcn time is described in a graphio way, there is heartiness in the invitation, and
the occasion is marked with dramatic distinctness in the concluding lines.

for the wara, and yet (with, the prince’s leave) it’s said he means to train for the
arena. There’s many a man who lives but for his palate, for whom hia creditor looks
out at the entrance of the markct. The poorcst live the best, just on thevcrge of
bankruptcy. Meanwhile they search tha elementa for dainties, regardless of the
price, or in their hearts preferring what is domest For men so recklesa it is not
