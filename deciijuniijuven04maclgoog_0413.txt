364 D. JU-NII J UVENALIS

Improbus aut campum mihi si vicinus ademit,
Et sacrum effodit medio de limite saxum
Quod mea cum patulo coluit puls annua libo;
Debitor aut 'sumptos pergit non reddere nummos, 40
Vana supervacui dicens chirographa ligni 3
Exspectandus erit qui lites inchoet annus
Totius populi. Sed tunc quoque mille ferenda
Taedia, mille morae ; toties subsellia tantum
Sternuntur, tum, facundo ponente lacernas 45
Caedicio et Fusco jam micturiente, parati
Digredimur lentaque fori pugnamus arena.

Quod placitum est ipsis praestatur tempus agendi,
Nee res atteritur longo sufflamine litis. , 50
