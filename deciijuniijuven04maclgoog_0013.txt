viii PREFACE.

Of the English translations 1 have referred to, those 01 Drydeu
and Gifford arethe ablest. Dryden has not translated 011 the
Satires. Holyday’s is a quaint piece of rhyming prose, with some
learned 110100. Ηο often 11110 the sense where others miss it. Dr.
Johnson's imitatione of the third and tenth Satires I have notieed
in their places. Happening to have the Italian translation by
Teodoro Accio (101ςο110, 1828), I have sometimes referred to it;
and have found it, as far as I have done so, sensible and 011011
0011001. Ibelieve it has a high reputation in Italy. ·

Having edited Horace for this series, I heve referred freely to my
own notes in that edition. I hope 1 shall not appear egotistical in
so doing. I must either have taken this course, or repeated almost
word for word what I had written before.

'lhis has been found still more necessary with respect to Persius,

who has imitated Horace 00 freely 00 10 compromise his character
- for originality‚ though he has merits, as well as (1010010, that are
his own. .
This author has lately been edited (Leipzig, 1843) with much
care by Otto Jahn, whose edition 01 Juvenal 10 mentioned above.
His notes 011 Persius 0101111110 style of Ruperti’s on Juvenal,
though they have more merit. Readers who wish to he referred to
0 great variety of authors and eritios, will use Jahn’s edition for
that purpose ¹. For the 0111110ίο meaning Heinrich is a better guide
in my opinion. His notes were edited 01 the request of his son by
Jahn the year after his own edition, and seven years 01101 the death
of Heinrich. They are shorter and less elaborate even than those
on Juvenal, but whatever Heinrich says is to 1110 purpose and the
fruit of his own intelligence. The freshness of that sort of oom-
mentary is very pleasant to those who have waded through a sea
of complicated notes, in which every thing more or less remotely
bearing upon the text 10 brought in to smother it. When are
authors 10 be made their editors’ first and only consideration? ⁴

The edition of Oasaubon represents the learning 01 that great

¹ J ahn's Prolegomena on the Life and Scholia and MSS. 01 Persius are the best part
of his book. Though long and rather tedicus, they are seholarlike and useful.
