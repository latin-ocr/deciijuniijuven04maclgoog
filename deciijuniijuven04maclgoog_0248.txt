· SATIRA VIII. 199

Exspectata diu tandem provincia quum te ,
Rectorem accipiet, pone irae fraena modumque,
Pone et avaritiae, miserere inopum sociorum 3
Ossa vides regum vacuis exsucta medullis. 90
Respice quid moneant· leges, quid curia mandet,
Praemia. quanta bonos maneant, quam fulmine justo
Et Capito et Numitor ruerint damnante Senatu,
Piratae Cilicum. Sed quid damnatio confert, ·
Quum Pansa eripiat quidquid tibi Natta reliquit? 95
Praeconem, Chaerippe‚ tuis circumspice pannis,
Jamque tace: furor est post omnia perdere naulum.
Non idem gemitus olim neque vulnus erat par

ι Damnorum sociis florentibus et modo victis. y
