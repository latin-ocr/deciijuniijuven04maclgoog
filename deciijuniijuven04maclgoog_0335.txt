286 D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Ite igitur, pueri, linguis animisque faventes,
Sertaque delubris et farra imponite cultris
Ac molles ornate focos glebamque virentem. 85

Inde domum repetam, graciles ubi parva coronas
Accipiunt fragili simulacra nitentia cera.
Hic nostrum placabo J ovem Laribusque paternis
Turadabo, atque omnes violae jactabo colores. 90

Et matutinis operatur festa lucernis.
