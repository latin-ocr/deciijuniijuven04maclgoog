SATIRA VI. 107

especially among women r and thess two were so mingled, that the very shrines which
cherished the one were the shameless soenes of the other. Extravagance without
generosity, and driven on by mad lust, bred covetousness, and covetonsusss murder, so
that poisoniugs were frequent and notorious. The conditione of domestic slawery gave
terrible scope for the caprices and violence which aelf-indulgence genemteu and the
sufferings of the poor wretches from the ill-temper of their mistreases is described in
language which bas the air of extravagsnce, but may nevsrtheless be accepted aa truc,
not only from the testimony of other writers, but fromthe natureofthe canatha known
character of the women, the legal and socisl position of the slave, and moreover the
experienee (perhaps in more exceptional cases) of modern times. The love of personal
display, of finery, of gonip, of public amusemeuts, and the affectation of learning, aud
the pride of birth, and the aelf-complacency of virtue, are strongly put, but not more so
than the present generation might readily bear. Gluttony and drnnkenncss are not
commonly reckoned among women's failings, but they appear to have been prevalent in
the time of Domitian. The folly which is perhaps most inexplicable, and without
parallel in our own days, was that of women of family engaging in the arena, and
practising as gladiatore, hunters, chariotesrs, and so forth, in tha Circus and Amphi·
theatra. 'sbat such was the niadness of the time there isno doubt ; and it forms one
of the many monstrous features of this satire, in which there are no traces of those
crimes which are usually associated with the nobler passione in women, jealousy,
disappointed love, ambition3 bnt allis grovelling, fflthy, depraved‚ aud despicably
meran.

The length of the poem and tho closeuess of the style render the following argument
correspondingly long, and the nature of the language and soenes unavoidably introduced
in the satire, bnt not iit to be reproduced, have made the argument defective. But it
gives a pretty faithful idea of the contents of the poem and its divisione. The force of
the original can only be known by reading it.

The date of the satire has been tired by some in Trajan’s reign, or about aa). 106.
'l'he arguments are derived from the allusione to the Armenian king in v. 407, and to
the way of dressing the hair described in v. 501. 'fhere is an allusion in v. 387 to the
Capitoline gamas, said to have been instituted by Domitian, from which it is inferi-ed
that the poem could not have been written before his reign, which the nature of it
would sufficiently show. 'l‘he notes on the above passages may be consulted.

Ican believe that when Saturnus reigned Modesty may have lived awhile on earth,
when caves were homes for men and cattle too, when skins and leaves were beds,
and wives were rude as their rude husbands, with stnrdy infants at the breast.
'stay lived not then as now when the world was new, the sous of clay, or of the
forest-trees.

V. 14. Some traces may have stayed even when Jove was king, but 'twas before he
wore a beard3 before the Greeks had learnt to swear and lie, when thieveswere
noman's dread. Inscnsibly Astraea left the world, and Modesty,he1·sistcr, went
with her.

V. 21. Adultery is an old affair, my friend ; the silver age begot it= every other vioe
the age succeeding bore. And yet at this late day you think'of marrying, nay
perhaps the barber's work is donc, and the ring given! Surely you once were sane;
what marry, Postumus? What mariness does possess you? While there's a rope
left will you bear a mistress, while there's a window or a bridge hard by?

V. 38. But you’ve a fancy for the Julian law, and you rnust have an heir and lose your
