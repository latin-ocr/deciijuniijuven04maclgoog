SATIRA 11. 393

Emeris auriculas? pulmone et lactibus unctis? ³0

Ecce avia, aut metuens divum matertera, cunis

Exemit puerum, frontemque atque uda labella

Infami digito et lustralibus ante salivis

Expiat, urentes oeulos inhibere perita.

Time manibus quatit, et spem macram supplice voto 35

Nunc Licini in campos, nune Crassi mittit in aedes.

‘Hunc optent generum rex et regina 3 puellae

Hunc rapiant 3 quicquid calcaverit hic rosa fiat l’
