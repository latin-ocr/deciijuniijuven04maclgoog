LIFE OF JUVENAL. ‘xxi

Independently of the chronological difficulties in· respect to Paris, it
does not appear that the verses quoted by the Grammarians were ever
intended as a satire on him, but if any thing as a compliment. So at
⁴ least they appear in the connexion in which we have them. And it is
perfectly clear that in that connexion they could not have given offence
to the emperor, whoever he was, since the Satira sets out from the first
with such praise as the worst of these princes coveted and rewarded,
praise for his exclusive support of learning. 1f therefore it had been
possible to admit these verses as the cause of Domitian’s displeasure, it
must have been when they appeared separately as an epigram, or with a
different context from the present, which it must be admitted they do
not very well suit, if, as seems anain, the rest of the Satira was written
long afterParis’ death. It is the way with the Roman Satirists to repre-
sent living names and characters by dead, and some have supposed that
by Paris is meant a favourits actor of a later reign. But though there
may have been later counterparts of Statius, it is not likely that there
was another Paris, or any one whom his name would represent, whether
with Hermann we refer the Satine to Trajan’s time, or, as Ι believe it
should be, to Hadrian’s.

As to the place of Juvenal’s supposed exile, I do not think it neces·
sary to argue the subject against Francke ¹, who denies the fastand
declares Juvenal never was in Egypt at all, or against Hermann ³, who
holds that he was sent to Scotland. I have no doubt he had been in
Egypt before he wrote the fifteenth Satira. That he ever visited
Britain I think cannot be proved, and it is not very likely. It is enough
to say that Agricola fought the last battle in Caledonia (on the Gram-
, pians) Au). 84, in which year he was recalled, having completely sub-
dued the country. But we have seen that Juvenal was at Rome as late
as Aa). 94, after which there was no fighting against the Scoti‚ and if it
was the emperor's desire that the poet should be killed, as the Gram-
marian says, he would not have been sent to join the troops in Britain
for that purpose. The inscription quoted by Hermann, if genuine, and
if it refers to our Juvenal, proves nothing in favour of a Caledonian
exile. [See thenoteon Sat. iii. 320. Ribbeck assumes that the inscrip-
tion there mentioned refers to the Satirist Juvenal, who according to this
inscription had served in the Roman armies, and as a commander of a
cohort of Delmatae or Dalmatae, and he adds ‘quoniam Dalmatarum
