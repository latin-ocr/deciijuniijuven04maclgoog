great crowds, and with great success, several times : so that 116 was led
to insert in his first writings those verses which 116 had written first :

‘Quod non dant proceres dabit histrio: tu Camerinos
111 Β61666, tu nobilium magna atria curas?
Praefectos Pelopea facit, Philomela tribunos 23

'l'he player was at that time one of the favouritcs at court, and many of
his supportem were daily promoted. Juvenal, therefore, fell under
suspicion as one who had covertly censured the fimes3 and forthwith
under colour of military promotion, though, he was eighty years of age,
he was removed from the city, and sent to be praefectus of a cohort
which was stationed in the farthest part 61 Egypt. That sort of
punishment was determined upon as being suited to a light and jocular
61161166. Within a very short time 116 1161 61 1611611611 6111 disgust.'’

'l'he chief points stated in the foregoing life 616, that Juvenal was the
son 616116111166111161161111611111111111 or by adoption (for this I suppose
the writer means) 3 that he was a praetised rhetorician; 'that 116 began
to write satire after middle life; that his first attempt was an epigram
upon Paris the pantomimus⁸3 that 116 was encouraged by the success 61
this production 16 write Satires on 6 larger scale, which 61 first he
concealed, but afterwards read them 16 large audiences with great
applause 3 that whereas he was rash enough to introduce in one 61 1116
poems the original epigram (which, 66 Ι suppose 1116 writer means 16
-imply, so became 111616 public, and probably for the first time reached
the ears of the person it was aimed at), Paris by his influence at
court obtained his banishment, under the honourable 161111 61 6 military
command, to the farthest part 61 Egypt ; that he was then eighty years
of age ⁴, and that he shortly died of vexation.

Another of these notices states that Juvenal was born at Aquinum,
in the reign of Claudius3 that he returned from 611116, survired the
reign 61 Trajan, and finally died 61 611 age in a fit 61 coughing,

In 6 third we are told that when he returned to Rome, finding his
friend Martial was dead, he died 61 grief in his eighty-second year.

A fourth says it was Domitian who exiled him; that he never re·
turned, but that after eerreeting and adding to his 8111166 in Egypt, he
died there of 611 age in the reign 61 Antoninus Pius.

From a fifth we learn that he was advanced to the equestrian rank
through his own merit3 that the place of his honourable exile was
Sootland, and that the 11161116 was that he might be killed 1111161116 ς
