Esse putes? quem vis hominem secum attulit ad nos: 75

Augur, schoenobates, medicus, magus: omnia novit.
Graeculus esuriens in caelum jusseris ibit.

Ad summam, non Maurus erat neque Sarmata nec Thrax
Qui sumpsit pennas, mediis sed natus Athenis. 80
Horum ego non fugiam conchylia? me prior ille
Signabit? fultusque toro meliore recumbet

Advectus Romam quo pruna et cottona vento?
