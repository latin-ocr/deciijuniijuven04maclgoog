Of Juvenal’s persona] character it is not so easy to forman estimato
from his writings as itis of Horace's. 'lhat 1116 invectivas against the
vices of his time are not 1116 16616 artistic and declamatory compositiora
which some writers suppose them to be, but the fruita cf an honest
indignation, of rare powers of sarcasm, and 616 large knowledge 611116
world, I think is manifest. His langnage is unreserved in dealing with
the 1661661 11666, but 111616 16 neappearance of his being himself a loose
’ liver 111 any part 61 his writings. When Horace is coarse he betrays

ἵ something of sympathy with vice, while Juvenal shows only contempt
161 11. Although therefore an expurgated edition of duvenal would
have mere gaps ‘than an expurgated edition 61 Horace, owed-regulated
mind would be 1666 offended with the entire text of Juvenal 'than with
tha't of Horace. duvenal's morality was ef 6 higher and 1666 1661161661 “
6611 than Horace’s‚ and has led some into the notion that he drew it
from 1116 purast source, and was in understanding, if not by profession,
‘a Christian. This 61666166 is absurd. He knew human nature, and
he knew right from wrong, end was 661 blinded by aelf-indulgence, and
<so was ahle 16 61616 the law 61 conscience in a way 16 astonish some
Christiane, to whom that 1611 16 very imperfectly known.

A-part from his morality Juvenal was a great master 61 words, and
had a large fund of illustration. His pictures drawn 1161111661 1116, as I
11616 observed in the course of 1116116166, 616 particularly happy: whether
they represent the common room 616 161616, 61 the deck 61 6 sh'ip, 61
the inside 616 soldier's hut 6161 6 camp, 61 6 6611661166111, 61 the greedy
crowd at the sportula, or 1116 6116616 61 Rome, 616 (1111111166111611, these
and a hundred other scenas are so drawn 11161611 611161 would have 116
difficulty in transferring them 16666166. But his hand mustbe vigorem
and his brush free, 61 he would do no justice to duvenal.

There is one particular form of lust thom which 'modern wickedness
shrinks, but which was one of the worst evils 'of Roman society under
the Empire. This vice is exposed 111 two Satires of great power (ii. 111).
The wickedness 61 women was never sounsparingly handled 66 11 16 16

'general degradation 61 Roman life and manners is exposed in the first,
third, and fourteenth Satires, and in 1116 last 61 these the chief cause of
1116 universal wickedness is laid open in the indifference of parents to
the morals of their young children, and the example which handed down
vice 66 611 inheritance from father to son. The degradation of 1116
