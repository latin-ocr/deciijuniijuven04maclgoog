assertion, and in many cases I have preferred the readings of other Ἴ
uss, of tuounup‘eru uss given a catalogue ano description. 1 '
myself am in possession of one which is not in Ruperti's list. Itis *
neatly written on parchment in 8vo. form, but is incompleta and of
no particular salue, being an Italian MS. of the early part perhaps
of the fifteenth century. As it is not a transcript of any MS.
referred to by other editors, I have occasionally notioed it, and
have* called it M. Many of its readings in disputed passages I
have rejected.

Ι have not followed implicitly the judgment of any editor. Jahn
and Hermann rely too much Ι think on the MS. they do well to
prefer. Hermann keeps more closely to it than Jahn, sometimesI
think with good reason. They have not published commentarios.
The notes to which I attach mostvalue are those of Heinrich,
published by himself without ue textin1806,1810,and repub-
lished by his son two years after his death (Bonn, 1839), witha
' text corrected in accordance with his father's commentary. These

notes did not satisly the judgment of Madvig, who thought them
beneath the reputation and abilities of their author. To me they
Α appear throughout manly and sensible, free from pedantry (the
plague of commentarie's), and worthy of the great writer whom it
is their only object to explain. As there is no ancient author that
requires masculine sense to understand and explain his meaning so
much as J uvenal, so I know of no commentator on any author that
surpasses Heinrich in that qnality. His notes are in German, and
Ι suppose this is the reason ‘why Ruperti's edition continues to be
much used by studente in this country. It is the work of an
industrious man of weak mind, always liable to waver when his
judgment happens to be right, but never to be relied upon in cases
of difficulty. Nor is he strictly honest, for he changed his interpre-
tations in some instances in his later edition, without acknowledging ,
that he was indebted to Heinrich for his second thoughts. A
smart an'd rather sarcastic review of Ruperti’s notes was put forth
by Heinecke (Halle,1804),and is sometimes referred to in the
notes 'of this edition. Heinecke is often wrong himself. He was
young when he wrote. The Parisian editor, Achaintre (1810), has
