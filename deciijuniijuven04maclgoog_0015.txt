tion, showing that they were both copied from a MS. written in
the ysaram. 402, by one Pl. Julius. 'l'he later of these, which is
at Rome, Heinrich collated. 'she collation of the earlier used by
Jahn is by Duebner. 'l'heir taslr was rendered more laborious by
the strange orthography of the MSS. and their many palpable
blunders. A more accurate and useful MS. is one of the tenth
century (which is not however complete), in the library of Bern.
There are several of the tenth and eleventh centur-ies, and it is clear
that Persius, though he must have been but little understood ², was a

good deal read among the semipagani of the mediaeval monasterias. '

The Satires of Persius are here joined with those of Juvenal,
according to a common practice. But except lor the convenience of
publication, there is no ‘reason why they should be so. United they
form a fair-sized volume, which separately they would not do
except by extending the notes on either to an inordinate and useless
length. Persius, though older than Juvenal, yet, as being less read
and of less importancc, is usually and rightly put after him.

It is easy to write long notes on such authors as these3 indeed

the difficulty is to write atmoderate length3 even without the prac-
tice, which I think objectionable, of overlaying the text with an
embarrassing heap of references. Among other ways of lengthening
this commentary was one which to some general readers would have
been acceptable. Ἰ might have dwelt upon the immorality of the
age, and contrasted the practice of the heathen with the contem-

porary precepts of the Christian. But I do not think any observa-
tions of mine would have strengthened the language of Juvenal,

and if I bave helped Christiana to read and understand him, I shall
be satisfied. They will be able then to compare the profligaey of
the degenerate Roman with the purity of the Christian’s profession,
and perhaps may find in the rehukes of the Satirist matter for more
usefrrl contemplation than that which dwells upon the vices and
superstitious of former ages, and overlooks the vices and super-
stitione of our own. ¹

² J obn gives an instance ofa gloss written in the eleventh century, ln the margin of
the last-named MS, on vi. 28: “ amasa Saea, i'n quibus Brutus superatus est.'’
