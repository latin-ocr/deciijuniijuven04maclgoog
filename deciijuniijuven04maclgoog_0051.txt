V. 19. My reesou for following in Horace’s steps is this—when eunuchs ere marrying
wives, ond women cre exhibiting in the arena, when s barber is challenging with his
weelth ull the uobihty, eud eleves ore cled in purple ond affecting their summer rings,
itis impossible to abstoin frum satire Who eeu restroiu himself when fet Matho
comes hy in his litter, und the grest informer after him, the terror of all little in·
formcrs 3 when you erethrust from your rights by wretches who get your inheritance
by sotirfyiug su old woman'slewdnessf Is it not enough to melre one’s blood boil
to see the robber tresding on people's heels with his crowd of sycophnuts, while his
werd is left to prostitution? and Marius going off into exile ιο sujoy himself with

, ιιο spoils of his province? what does ιο cere for infumy if he keeps his plunder?
Are these not fit themesfor the muse of Venusia? What have I ιο do with the
old hackneyed topics when wretches are found ιο winlr οι their wives' intrigues, und
telio the property of,the adulterer which the low will uot give ιο ιιο woman t when
ο speudthrift expects ιο ιο promoted ιο high places for the elrill with which ιο
hsndles the relus while the grest men lounges with his minion behind? Does not
oue feel inclined to tole out one’s teblets in the very street when the forger eomes
loungiug along iu his open litter, eud the great lady meets him who hes drugged her

mustbe s hold misereaut if you went ιο ιο somebody. Honesty is praised oud lert to
storve. 'l'o crime men owe all their fine gurdone, sud houses, and furniture. Who
ceu sleep for theincest und adultery thetis going on? If neture refuses, indignation ⁴
drews the pen, though it be but such es mine or Cluuienus'.

V. 80. Allthe passions of men from the deluge to this dny ure the motley subjects of my
book. When was the harvest of vice more abundent? when did uveriee so fill its
begs f When hed the die such spirit ss now when men plsy not for the contente
of their purse but of their chest f Loolr et the hotness of the encounter! Abundred 1
sestertio lost end the poor shivering slave without etunie3 is not this something more
then msdnessf Which of our ancestors ever built such villus, ordined by himself
oh* seven coursesf Now-a-deys the poor client hus ιο scremble for e peltry dole
grudgingly und cautiously given, oud from this he iselhowed by some great pauper who ἵ
musthuve his share first3 or else some well-todo freedmcn eries, “ I cume first, and
must be first served; lem rich too, end riches ure better thou rsulr.” And of course
the cleim must be ollowed ς ιιο rich slave before the poor magistrate, for though
money hes not yet hod utemple eud altem, her mejesty is sboveull others sacred. But
ifour high officere ere not above reckoning upon the sportula, what will their
followers do who get ull they heve from this source f Crowds of litters come up for the
dole, undull lriud of frsud goes ou. ’
