Thon, or soon afterwards, Juvenal was allowed to give up his command
and return to Rome, being at the time of his return about forty years of
age. Martiale epigram proves that he was not altogether independent
or comfortable about this time. Nerva reigned less than two years, and
Trajan succeeded to the empire nn. 98, and in the early part of his
reign, soon after An. 100, Juvenal first published a volume of Satires

(of which the first in our collection was one), having already recited them
to large audiences. It is Ποῖ unlikely that some of these, or parts of
them, had been composed in the reign of Domitian ¹, or even earlier, bnt
that the poet had not ventured to make them public. He continued to
write freely during Trajan’s reign, which ended An. 117, when Juvenal
was about sixty, and during the early years of Hadrian’s reign, that is,
till about nn. 120. During this reign he may have lived in comfort
through the liberality of the emperor, though his honsehold was on a
frugal scale, as he tells us in Sat. xi, from which (v. 65) we learn that
he had property at Tibur. It is not impossible he may have lived till
the accession of Antoninus Pius, who succeeded Hadrian An), 138, when
Juvenal was, according to'this sketch, eighty or a little more.
x Thus the statements of the Grammarians in respect to the poet’s age,
and of that writer who says he died of old age in the time of Antoninus
Pius, would be borne out. I have also allowed the fact of an honour·
'able banishment into Egypt, though not the cause assigned by the
Grammarians, which is impossible. That Juvenaldid not professedly
‘ compose satire till late in life, is admitted and accounted for. Likewise
ι that he may have written verses before he ventured to publish them,
and that some of these were afterwards incorporated with his Satires, is
allowed. Itis also admitted that he attended the usual schools in early
life, and ¹practised rhetoric till middle age. Beyond these facts the
Grammarians Ι believe have been misled, probably by mistaken infer·
ences drawn from allusions in the Satires themselves, a fertile source of
error and of pretended learning on the part of the Scholiasts on all the
ancient authors.

The fact of the banishment, though allowed as not being chronolo-
gically impossible, Ι nevertheless think isan error, but an early one, as
is proved by a verse quoted from Sidonius Apollinaris, who believed the
whole story, including Paris' share in it. He wrote about the middle oi
the fifth century, and says (Canu. ix. 270, sqq.):

“Non oui tempore Caesaris'seeundt
Aeterno coluit Tomos reatu (ie. Ovid);
Nec qui consimili deinde casu,

Ad vulgi tenuem strepentis auram,
lrati fuit histrionis exul.”
