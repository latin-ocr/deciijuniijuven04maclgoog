78 D. J UNII JUVENALIS

V. ⁷5. 'l’be word is given ; Pegasus first snatches up his cleak, the new-made bailifl' of
the city, fer what elsethen were praefecta? an excellent judge, but mueh too merciful
fertbe times he lived in. Pleasant old Crispus next, whose hcart was like bis speech,

a mau of gentle temper: an excellent eompanion for the world's master if hs might ι
speak his honest mind. But who dare speak to such a tyrant, when on every trivial ¹

sentence hung one's life? Crispus was not theman to swim against the stream, and
risk his life ior truth. And so hs lived in safcty eighty years. Thea came Acilius
with his poor son, unworthy oi that savage death. But greatness and great age have
long been strangers. Let me be humble brother ef the gianm In vain be pierced
the bear in the Alban eireus. Who does not see through such patrician tricksi’
Brutus might cheat your king with along heard. Rubrius eomes next, not less de-
jeeted though less noble 3 convicted ot' an old and foul offenoe, but shameless as the
fllthy satirist. Montanus next with his big belly comes. Crispinus with his morning
scente: Pompeius too, whose soitest whisper was adagger: Fuscus, who dreamt of wara
in his marble villa, and kept his bowels fer the Dacian vultures Cratty Veiente then,
and blind Catullus who insted for a maid he could not see; a special monster even for
our times, iit but te beg by the read side. Hs matches all in admiration, looking to
the left while the brute lay on his right 3 just as he did in the theatra, praising the
fightersaud maehinery. Veiente like amadman prophesiae. “Here is an omen οι·
buge triumph ; some king shall be your prisoner; den’tyouseetbebrute'saforeigner?”
Fabricius could all but tell the animal's country and its age.

V. 1³0. “ Well now, what think ys, isit to bs cuti’' “Nay,” says Montanus, “far be

clay and whee13 henoeferth, 0 Caesar, potters must wait upon your court !'' His
motion was adopted, worthy oi a man who knew the ways of Nero's court, ne ons
has beat him in my time for knowledge of the table. He'd tell you at a teste where
an oyster came stom, and told at sight the echinus' native coast.

V. 144 'l’he council rise and are discharged; summoned in haste, as if some ten-ibic
news had· come from far. Would that in trifles such as these had passed the savage
days in which he robbed the city ef her noblest spirits, without a hand te avenge
them. But his time camewhen the mean begantofear him. 'Twas this that ruined
him, though his hand reeked with noble blood.
