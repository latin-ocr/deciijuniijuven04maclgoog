considered the best. I have 1101 made the collation myself, but Ι have
examinari it aud I· hope it is sufficient. This collation does not show
the differences in orthography, where the words are 1116 same, nor 1116
differences in punctuation except iu some cases where these differences
effect 1116 661166. Ι have examined all the passages in which these two
texts differ, and Ι find a great many in which Macleane's text is better
than that 01 Jahn, who has introduced semebad readings. I have
observed 6 few passages in which I should prefer Jahn's text, but on
the whole I think the Englishman has shown more good sense and
judgment than the German.

I have added in the 110166 nearly all the variations of Ribbeck's text.
Many of Ribbeck’s variatione are the same as Jahn’s, but he has some 01
his own, and most of them seem to me bad. Some of his transpositione
· improve 1116 text, but most 01 them do not. He has handled the sixth
Satira so freely as to the transposition and omission 01 verses, that
it would require much time and study to pass a just judgment on his
labour; but it will be generally allowed that the matter of this Satire,
as it stands in the common texts, is not well arranged.

Ι have made many small corrections in Mr. Macleane’s notes, where
111616 was some slight erroror mis-statement, but Ι have omitted nothing
and altered nothing which Ι believe the editor would not have omitted
or corrected. He would probably have changed his opinion 011 some
points, and would both have omitted and altered much more than I have
done, 101 my business was not to edit Juvenal and Persius, but 1ο pre·
serve the work 01 my friend. The references inthis volume are very
numerous, and the causes of errors in the figures 01 such references 616
various. I 11616 corrected a great many wrong references, and though
Ι cannot hope that I have corrected all, Ι believe that the 611016 which
remeia are not many. In the references to the MSS. Ι have discovered
a few slight errors since this book was printed, but they are not such as
10 require any particular notice. Ι have added a little in the notes here
and there, where Ι thought it necessary. All the additions which
I have made 616 marked thus [ ].

Ribbeck has publishedanessayonduvenal(“DerEchteundderUnechte
Juvenal, Berlin,'’ 1865), which is 10 some extent ajustification of his
text. After briefly stating how much we learn from Juvenal of Roman
manners from 1116 time 01 Tiberius 10 Trajan and Hadrian, he adds that
this knowledge is got exclusively from the first nine Satires and the
eleventh; that the tenth, twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth
supply scarcely any information 01 the kind. They contain 111616 allu-
sione to well-known names and persons, or introduce characters of
various kinds, which are not marked by any individuality. The genuine
Juvenal is a follower of Lucilius, and though he did not lash hia con»
