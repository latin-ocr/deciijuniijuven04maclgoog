Armenia was finally subdned by Trajan. In v. 120the sameMarins
is referred to as having ‘nuper’ stripped the Africana. But ‘nuper’ is
used with much latitude, and the name of Marius was long held in
remembrance as the great spoiler of provinces, having been made more
notorious through the celebrity of Tacitus the historian and Pliny the
younger, who were employed to prosecute him, just as the speeches of
Burke and Sheridan against Warren Hastings have perpetuated and
spread the ill-fame of his Indian government.

It is certain that the fourth Satine was written after the death of
Domitian, Aa). 96, since his death is expressly mentioned in the last two
verses. This Satira therefore may be assigned to the reign of Nerva
from September, an. 96, to January, nn. 98, or very early in his suc-
cessor Trajan’s reign. The subject would only amase soon after the
. tyrant's death.

The twelfth Satira, which refers to Trajan’s basin in the Portus
Augusti (v. 75, dic), must have been written in his reign or after it.
This argument assumes what there is no good reason to doubt, that the
· Scholiast is right in attributing this work to Trajan ’.

According to these calculatione eight out of the sixteen Satires were
written after the death of Domitian. The sixteenth is a fragment, and
it may be admitted that, if not the last written, it was not begun very
long before the last, whichever that may have been. Thus more than
half the extant Satires were written, as Ι suppose, between aa). 96 and
A.n.120,or some of them possibly a little later, a period of at least
twenty-four years.

If any credit is due t'o the statement of the Grammarians, in which
they all agree, that Juvenal did not begin to write in this style till he
was near middle life, we may suppose that none of the Satires were
written much before the death of Domitian. We cannot tell how long
the vigorous spirit that appears in all these poems may last, and show
itself in compositions of this sort. It is no argument to say that Horace
soon got tired of Satire. His mind and circumstances were very diffe-
rent from Juvenal’s. But twenty-four years alter the period of middle
life carries a man on to an age when, under almost any circumstances,
the mind loces its heshnsss and seeks rest, at least thom the excitemcnt
of such compositions, and I think Juvenal could not have been more
than forty, and probably not so much, when Domitian died. This may
be affirmed whether the Grammarians have stated the truth >on the
above point or not, if my calculations are not altogether wrong. This
