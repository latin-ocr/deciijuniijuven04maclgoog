268 D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Functus ad has epulas solito maturius ibat,

Erectum domito referens a monte ligonem.
Quum tremerent autem Fabios durumque Catonem 90
Et Scauros et Fabricios, postremo severos

Nemo inter curas et seria duxit habendum,
Qualis in Oceani fluctu testudo nataret,

Sed nudo latere et parvis frons aerea lectis
Vile coronati caput ostendebat aseHi,
Ad quod lascivi ludebant ruris alumni.
Tales ergo cibi qualis domus atque supellex.
