sATIRA V.

Hic Campo indulget 3 hunc alea decoquit3 ille
In Venerem est putris: sed cum lapidosa cheragra
Fregerit articulos veteris ramalia fagi, '
'lunc crassos transisse dies lucemque palustrem σο
Et sibi jam seri vitam ingemuere relictam.
At te nocturnis juvat impallescere chartis,
Cultor euim juvenum purgatas inseris aures
Fruge Cleanthea. Petite hinc, juvenesque senesque,
Finem animo certum miserisque viatica canis. σο
“Cras hoc fict.'’ Idem cras fiet. “ Quid, quasi magnum
Nempe diem donas ?” Sed cum lux altera venit,
Jam eras hesternum consumpsimus: eece aliud cras
Egerit hos annos, et semper paulum crit ultra.
Nam quamvis prope te, quamvis temone sub unc 70
Vertentem sese, frustra sectabere canthum,
Cum rota posterior curras et in axe secundo.
