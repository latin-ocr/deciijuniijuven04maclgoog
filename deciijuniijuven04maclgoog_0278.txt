SATIRA X. 229

yon lik'e promotior, a'nd why uotl But what ia rank if misery ιο its measure ι
Which would you rather take, Sejenm’ toga or the rag's of a country hedilo? Ηο
ιιοη, yon must allow, lmew not what he should aske for he who prayed for too much

- power did only build himself a tower ιο sall the farthor from. What ruined Crassus,

· Caesar, and Pompeius? The rank thoy sought by every art, and gods too prone to
listen to their prayers.. Few kings and tyranta die a natural doeth.

V. 114. Boya pray Minerva for Demosthenss' or Cicero’s eloquence‚ and yet 'twas

ι thiatbat killed them. ’Twas Genius thet lost its head and hande. Small pleaders

· never dyedthelbostra with their blood. Had hs writ all as ιο wrote poetry, then
Cicero might have mockod Antoniua' swords. l’d rather ιο tho author οι his poems
¹than of his famous speech. A cruel death was his too who hald ιιο reins of tho mn
theatro before admiring Athena, whom with bad omens born hia iathar sent to school
fromthe forge.

V 133. Τιο spoils of war some count the height of human happiness ior this do all
great captains ronse themselves. 'lho‘thirat lor famo is greater than lor virtue: l'or
take away her honours who would lova her? 'l'he glory of a few then, thirsting ιοι·
epitaphs ιο ιο inscribed upon their tomb till the lig splits ithae wrecked their
country: tomba themselves must pensh -›

V. 147. Weigh Hannibal: how many pounds ιιι ιιοι grum general 'whom Africa could ·
not hold? Ηο wius Hispania, lsaps across tho Pyr'enoes, and splits the Alps with

. vinegar. Now he s in Italy3 that’a not enough3 ιο οοιιηιο it nothing till he planta

, his flag in theatreets of Romo. Δ glorious picture that,'the ono-eyed captain on his
elephant! What was the issue thani Ι0 glory! ιο himselfis beaten, sent into
exile, and there sits attho hing's door till he ιο pleasedtowalro. Τιο soulthatshoolr
the world a ring laid low. (ιο, fool, and scale ιιο Alpa, that boys may leorn to
wonder and declaim.

V. 168. For Pella'e boy οηο world was not enough . its narrow limita were ιο him as

, Gyarus or Seriphos: yet when he cameto Babylon a coffin satisfled him. Death

⁴ reveals how small we little· men are.. -

V. 174. The credulous believe that Xerxes cut. through Athos and all the lies οι
Greek historians: he bridgsd the sea* and dranlr np rivers, floggod ιιο winde and

‚ chained the Barth-shakcr-how merciful not ιο have branded him! Suro any of the
gods would ιο hia slavo! But how did he ‘get book from Salamis? Why with ono
ahip through sees choked with ιιο corpses of his men. This was the penalty his glory
found.

V. 189.⁸ ‘Give me long life, 0 Jove, and many years!'’ So unabashed and eagerly
you pray. Butage is full of ills: annglyface, tough ahin, cheelssflabby, wrinlrlos lilro

. a monkey. In youth there’s some variety, old men are all alilre: with trembliug voice

, end limhs, bald head and running nose‚andtoothless garns, a bnrden tothemselvesand

ι all about thom. Hie toste isgone, of meat and drinh I mean, for as to pleasure of
another sort, that he has long forgot. Thelinest musio gives him no enjoymeut. What
matter where ιο sits at the theatro l He cannot hear the vary horna and trumpots.
His slave must bawl when visitors aro announced or when he tella him what'a o'cloclr.
Τιο blood runs cold and scanty in his veina. A troop οι all dheaaea daucos roundhim ι
so numerous I could sooner rockon Hippia’s lovers, Themison’a victims, all the part·
nera Basilus has cheated and all ιιο wards Hirrus has robbed‚ 'how many 'villas my
old barber has. One has the rheumatism, ohe the lumbago, one sciatica. this one is
blind, that one is fed byt ο t;hcrs he who would grin once ot the sight of diuum, now

ι gapes like a young awallow for his food. But worst of all ιο dotage that forgeta its
servants, friends, and children: makes a will and gives its money to ohorlot. But
though he keeps his senses ιο ιηηοι see his friends all dying round him. This' ιο tho.
