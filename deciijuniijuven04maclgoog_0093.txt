we're ne match, they have the hest of it'who never cesse 110111 actiug. No woman iu
the house is safe from them, resolved te worm their master’s secreta out aud get him
in their power.

V. 114. ‘⁶ speaking of Greeks, let's pass to the Gymnasiis and to a crime 01 deeper dye.
Thiuk ef that Stoie who killed Barea, betrayed his friend aud pupil, the old wretch
bornat Tarsus. There is 110 reem for Romans here, where slaves ofGreece are kings,
who keep their great friends to themselves and thrustme from their doorshy poiseucus
lies pcculiar tc their triber se all my faithful services are gone. It matters nothing
now to lose a client.

V. 126. “What are a poor mau's services, when praetera rush before them to do their
homage to rich childless ladies? 'Phe freeman’s seu waits ou awealthy slave who
speuds a tribuue's pay on oue night's lust, while you would hesitate 10 hire a
common prestitute. Bring up a witness honest as Nasica, picus as Numa 01· Μ1-

quit the equestrian bench, you're poor: the bawd's son must sit here, the gladiator’s,
or traiuer’s ς’ 10 Otho has arranged it. What poor man gets a wife, or an iuheritauee,
or humblestofficei' All Romans true should long ago have joined 10 dy their country.
'Tishardtorise where virtue is kept down hy poverty, but hardest bere at Rome, where
foed aud lodging are so dear. .

V. 168. “Here is 1 man ashamed to diue 011 earthenware. Not 10 when he goes 110111
Rome 10 the bills aud Sabine fare. Iu many parts ef Italy no 0111 puts en the ‘ tega'
till he's dead. At the country plays you'll see in the grussy theatra both great aud
small dressed all alike in their white tuuics. Here meu dress beyond their means and
borrow money 3 ’tis a common rice, ambitious poverty. Here all things must be
bought. How much will you give te call ou Cossus, or for 1 glauce from Veiento? If ’
1 slave's hair is cut or his heard shared, cakes are poured in upon him, which he sells;
and here‘s more 111111 10 1111 your bile ,- we must pay toll, and swell the saviugs of the
favourite slave.

V. 190. “Audin the country who fears falling heusen? Rome 11 shored up with but·
tresses; aud when he has patched our houses thus, the villicus bids us sleep secure.
I'd rather live where there are uo fires or miduight terrers. The lower roem's on iire—
your garret smokes and you're asleep7you get uo notice till the dames are ou you.
Codrus has little fer the 111110 take, but loses all that little, aud goes forth 10 bega

himself, for he is richer hythe lire thau ever.

V. 223. “if you cau quit the circus, you may buy at Sora er such placesahouse for what

V. 232. “ Here sick meu die of watcbing (and their sickuess 11 all from uudigested foed

relliug eart aud shouting of the driaers iu the narrow streete shall keep a sea-eslf

V. 239. “The rich man rides 11 his ease, while the poor must push his way through
crowds that crush his 101111. 01 break his head, or tread upeuhis toas. See there the
