SATIRA III.

INTRODUCTION.

'ime Satira contains as fine waiting end us much power of condensed expression, with·
out grest obscurity‚ as uny that Juvenal hes written. There ie not thesemo breadth
end scope in Persius' writings ss in Juvensl’s, but some ef the passages in this poem
Juvenal has not, I think, surpassed. The resder will judge for himself.

The poet begins with complaining of the habit of young men westing their time iu
debeuchery st night, and in bed in the morning; end then supposes s scene in which a
youth is lying in bed as usuul tilla lete hour, and one of hie companions comes and wukes
him. He starts up in arage, sbuses his servants, (besses, and goes off to his work. In·
stead of writing what he has to write, he begins abusing his pens end hisink 3 where·
upon the poet takes him up, and reads him alesson upon idleness, pride, und debauehery3
- telling him he is old enough to know better than to waste his time like a schoelboy ;
that he hes not the excuse oss vicione, gross nature, and of those who ure herdened in
their ignorance ς end thet if conscience lays hold of him he will findite tortures worse
than sll thet tyrsnny ever invented.¹ In all of this there is much solemn wisdom and
grave though vigorous reproof. He treats the men as s weuk child, with his excuses
snd his presumption, and bids him go back to his nursery and his pap, or go te the
potter’s and get turned again, as a pot thathee been mede of soft watery clay. The con·
dition of one who is falling inte despair, with fcere in his bosom too grem for his wife
to know, is described in u few terrible words, and the severity of his punishment is
excellently told.

'Iba above imaginary scene occupies half the satire. 'l'he other hslf is more geuersl.
It teaches us to begin early, before life hus become teinted end medicine ofno uveil, to
study the nature end end of our being, our relation to others, and our duty to (lod. Let
us get wisdom, und despice the gsins of the worldly aud the ridicule of the vulgar.
'she course wit of the soldiers st the expense of the philosophare, and their sslf-eom·
plecency in the contemplation of their own ignor-enee, ere represented in the best style
