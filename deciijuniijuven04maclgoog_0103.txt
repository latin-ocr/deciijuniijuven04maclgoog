D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Usque adeo nihil est, quod nostra infantia caelum

Hausit Aventini, bacea nutrita Sabina? 85
Quid, quod adulandi gens prudentissima iaudat

Ille sonat quo mordetur gallina merito.

Haeo eadem licet et nobis laudare; sediliis

Creditur. An melior quum Thaida sustinet, aut quum
Uxorem comoedus agit vel Dorida nullo

Cultam palliolo? Mulier nempe ipsa videtur 95 ,
Non persona loqui : vacua et plana omnia dicas

Infra ventriculum et tenui distantia rima.
