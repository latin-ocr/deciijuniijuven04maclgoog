alre OF JUVENAL. xxiii

institution of a haughty people, but now obedient to the wantonness of
a tyrant who mocked its weakness and played with its servility, is
amusingly shown in the fourth Satire. The fifth exposce a different
sort of servility, that of parasitos, who sell their independence and
accept contempt for the sake of a meal grudgingly given, a low practice
which was more systematized at Rome, if it was not much more common,
than it is in our own country. The neglect of litemy men has a Satira
to itself (the seventh); aristocratic pride has another (the eighth). The
cunning of will-hunters' is hit off at the end of the twelfth, which is not¹
among the most interesting of these compositione. It relates chiefly to
the arrival of a fiiend after a dangerous voyage,‘and is more of the
nature of a familiar letter than of a Satire. The diehouesty of the age

is described in the thirteenth Satira, which contains some of duvenal’s ,

finem verses, and shows him in the beat character. This also isin the
torm of an epistle to a friend, and so is the eleventh, which contains an

invitation to dinner, and contrasts the poet's own plainnesa of living with ,

theluxurious habitsof hie contemporaries. Thus Juvenal goes through all
the great scandale of hia day, and treats them unaparingly. ‘The crimes
and criminals of former 'reigns are fieely introduced by way of illustra·
tion, but this is because the vices of one reign represented those of
another and the names of the dead could be more saiely used than of
the living. Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, Nero, Otho, Domitian, are all
brought up from time to time to point a moral or illushate some aspect
ol crime.

The most celebrated of duvenal’s poems, the tenth, has more of the
declamatmy character, which come of his critice attribute to all. Itis
on the vanity of human wishes, which is illustrated chiefly by historical
examples, and the poem has not much hearing upon the particrdar
character of his times. It ia the finest specimen of that sort of com·
position that Ι am acquainted with. The fifteeuth Satira is connected ψ
with a soene of little general interest, an Egyptian equabble, Juvenal’s
own interest in which can only be accounted for by his having been in
the country where it happened, The last Satire, if it had been com·
pleled, would have finnished a sketch of military life, sarcastic but
good-hamound, from which a good deal uf informatien might have been
derived.
