SATIRA I.

INTRODUCTION.

· Tne object of this satire is to ridicule the literary teste of the day. 'Phe poet begins
witha verse supposed to be taken from a poem of his orum, which he begins repeating to
a friend. The friend tells him uo one will read his poetry3 aud this gives him occasim
ιο express his contempt for public opinion and his reasons for despising it; which are,
that while every body must write and spent, every body writes and sponte for effect, aud
noue are satistied without vulgar applause. So meu write lewd verses to catch wauton
ears, and mincing staff to plesse the delicate critica. 'l’he man upon his trial is uct
satisfied unless the court applaudhis eloqueuce. And what is this epplenus? The rich
man hesit of course, while behind his back he is only laughed αις aud whoevergets it
must be content ιο share it with the feeblest drivellers, and to earu lt by paudering to
a viciens teste, and avoiding all offense to the great people. He appeals at last ιο the
admirere cf the worthies of the old Greek comedy—“ Eupolis atque Cratinus Aristopha-
nesque poetae”-and is ready to abide by their judgment.

We eauuot rightly infer from this that Persius bad written or had not written iu
any other style than satire. 'l'he opening verse is not oue he would have chosen asa
specimen of his style if he wished to produce something very good, and it is plainly
only made for the occasion. Itis neither very good nor very bad. It is a specimen oi
the morbid school of sentimental poetry, and reminds us of the celebrated parody ef
Byrou iu the Rejected Addresses, “ Where nought is every thing, aud every thing is
nought ;’' and though it is not impossible that Persius may have suffered for some of
his juvenile productione, as our poet had suffered before he wrote the English Barda
und Scotch Reviewers, in which the spirit of this satire is sometimes seen, there is uo
necessity for supposing it was written under such provocetien.

'she form in which itis written, involving frequent interruptione and many supposed
speakers and several quotations from poems of the day and opposing sentimenta and
criticisms, constitutos the chief difficulty of the satire. Ι have tried to make these
mattersplaiu, but I have hed to differ in turn from the other commentatore, sometimes
agreeing with one aud sometimes with another. Any one who tries to read the satire
without a great deul of study and without help, will see how difficolt it is ιο follow the
argument and to determine the arrangement. The allusione are soon disposed of, and
do not constitute the chief difficulty in reading Persius.
