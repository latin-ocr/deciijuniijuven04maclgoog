SATIRA Ι.

Pensilibus plumis, atque illino despiciat nos?

“ Quum veniet contra digito compesce labellum ι
Accusator erit qui verbum dixerit, Hic est.
Securus licet Aeneam Rutulumque ferocem
committas, nulli gravis est percussus Achilles,
Aut multum quaesitus Hylas urnamque secutus.
Ense velut stricto‘quoties Lucilius ardens
Infremuit, rubet auditor cui frigida mens est
Criminibus, tacita sudant praecordia culpa.

Inde irae et lacrimae. Tecumprius ergo voluta
Haec animo ante tubas : galeatum sero duelli
Paenitet.”-Experiar quid concedatur in illos 170
Quorum Flaminia tegitur cinis atque Latina.
