SATIRA IX.

INTRODUCTION.

'laus satire will not be read with any plessnre. It is nevertheless written with much
power. It is a dialogus between two acquaintances, one of whom has been making a
livelihood by the vilest services rendered to effeminate men. His friend expresses
surprise at his melanchcly appearance, which hc explains by the scantiness of his weges
snd the hopelessuess cf his prospecte The humour and severity of the sastire consist iu
the gravity of tha mau’s complaints against Fortuna end against his lllthy employer,
whom heupbraids with meenness and reproachfully reminds of the great services he had
rendered him, particularly in getting him children, which he was unable to get sor himself.
'Phe character of injuredinnocencs and unrequited industry which theman actsthrough·
,out and the affected seriousness of the frieud’s sympathy aud counsel, ars sufficiently
amusing. But the subject is disgasting, and only the surpessiug iniquity of the age
’ could have justified the author to himself for devoting another satira to it. 1 have giren
no argument.
