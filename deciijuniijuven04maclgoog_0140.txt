SATIRA V.

INTRODUOTION.

10Ῑο satire professes to be addressed 10 000 Trebius, the representative of a class of
men, who being poor and exquisitely servile, were willing to part with their indepen-
denoe and put up with all sorta 01 contemptuous treatment for the sake 01 0 dinner at
the tables of the rich. h specimen of such a dinner is given, at which Varro the host
reserves for himself and his rich friends the best of every thing, meat and fruit and
wine, aud the parasites are sulkily served with the worst, by slaves too 1100 10 make up
to the guests for the master's neglect. Juvenal's conclusion is, that they who will put
‘up with such treatment deservo it; and the rich manis not much to blame if he
despises those who are only drawn to his table by the 0000, thetis, by the savourof
his kitcheu.

110 satire has its moral for modern society, in which, 11110 relation of host and
guest 10 prevented by good breeding from taking the form here represented, eating and
servility are scarcely less prominent features than they were at Rome in its worst
days. If the rich look down upon the poor, it is usually because of the homage rank
and riches meet with; and that this homage comes 01 selfishness none know better
than those who receive it. 110 coveting of what is called good society is the vice 01 0
rotten system and 110 man who seeks company which does not want him has no
reason to complain 11 his pride is galled aud his expectatione are disappoiuted. lf thero
were no Trebiuses in the world there would be no Virros: so Juvenal thought 5 aad ho
does well to lay the 01101 weight 01 110 satire upon the parasite.

latter condition as only another phase 01 the former. The old institution died out with

ARGUMENT.

If you are not yet ashamed 01 110 life yon have chosen, living at other men’s
charges, and submittiug to any thing for a dinner, 1 would not believe you on your
oath. 110 stomaoh wants but little; but suppose ]00 have 001 1101 little, why can’t
