D. J UNII JUVENALIS

Crimine persona est? Mullum sex millibus emit, 15
Aequantem sane paribus sestertia libris,

Ut perhibent qni de magnis majora loquuntur.

Est ratio ulterior maguae si misit amicae,

Quae vehitur clauso latis specularibus antro.

Nil tale exspectes: emit sibi, Multa videmus

Quae miser et frugi non fecit Apicius. Hoc tu
Succinctus patria quondam, Crispina, papyro

Hoc pretium squamae! Potuit fortasse minoris 25
