SATIRA ΙΙ. 23

Τοο most corrupt may therefore well despise these moralists, aad turn the tables on
them, as Lauronia did when she heard one cry for the Julian lawr “0 happy times
(cried she) with such a bulwark for its morals! Let the town blush, another Cato is
come down from heaven! But whence, pray, this persumery? If you must call old

lawa up from their rest, you’d better summan the Scantiniam first. Lech at the meu,
for they are worse than we, but their compact array and numbers save them; the
lewd will hang together: among usnonght so detestablc is found. Say, do we meddle
with the forum and the lawsi’ A few, and but afew,areseen in the arena. But γοα
will sit and spin and do our women’s work better, yea than the hest of us. We all
know who was Hister's heir, and hy what complaiscnce his wife got rich; andethcrs
nray do likewise. And yet we are condemned γ and censure speres the raven to hunt
down the dove.'' These Stoica flod confused before the truth of her rebuke.

V. 65. What will not others do when you put on those clothes of gauze and go and
preach before admiring crowds against the female sinners, Creticus? They would at
least put on a decent toga ifit came to that. ‘⁶ But it is so hot‚” say you: why then
gonaked ; madness is less disgraceful. Look at the dress in which, had you lived
then, our hardy ancestcrs had seen you iu the rostra. Would yon not cry out,
“ Heaven and earth !” if γοα saw a judex so attiredl’ How would a witness look in
clothes like thesei And yet you, steru unbending Stoic, go transpaaent!

V. 78. Τοο infection has spread, and will further spread, like murrain among sheep, or
scurf in pigs, or contagione rot from grape to grapa. Yon will go on to something
worse than this. The height of wickedness is reached ογ slow degrees. Soon we
shall see γοα among those who mock the rites of Bona Dee, driving out the women, 4
and keeping up such orgies es the Baptae tire Cotytto with. They wear long garlands
on their heads and jewels on their neck, and sacrifice, and pour libatione. Here one

' painte his eyebrows and makes his eyes look languishing: another drinks from an
obscene glass with his long locks tisd up in a net of gold, with a handsome tunic,
while his slave swears ογ his master's luno! Another holds a mirror to his face such
as vile Otho carried when he went to the wara ς anovel piace of furnitnre for a camp !
of course it is a great man’s part tc kill a tyrant-and tc mind his skin ; to aim at
empires —and to smooth his face. Semiramis and Cleopatra did not ao. Here is no
reverence for the table, none ς but Cyhele’s foul licence aad the languishing voices
fanatic high priest with his white hair, rara glatton he and master of his art. Isong
since they should have cut their useless parta, as the Phrygian priests are wont.

v. 117. Gracchus his portion brought to a trumpcter: the marriage deeds were signed ς
the blessing spoken ; the feast prepared ; the new bride lay upon his husband’abosom.
Ye nobles! need we the censor cr the haruspex berei What if a woman celred or e
ccw lambedi you'dshuddermore and count them greater monsters. The priest of
Mars who sweated with the ancilia puts on a bridal dress! Gradivus, whence this
shame to Latin shepherds? whence have thy sous this itch? A man of birth and
wealth marries a man, and yet thy wrath is still! quit then the plain which thou dost
so neglect. “I must be up betimes, and do my dnty ογ the Quirinal.’' “What dutyi’f
“What duty! why my friend will take auhusband-the marriage will be private?
Bat soon there’ll be no privacy, they'll arant to put it in the news. And yet they
must die barren (this tormenta them), in spite of herba aud the Lupercus’ blows.

V. 143. But this is less than noble gladiatore, who scour the arena, better born than all
the fans folk who look on by the podium, yea than the great nran too who gives the
gemes. The fables about manes, Styx, and Charon’s boat we leave to babes. But
only think them true, and what would all those mighty spirits say when such a
chade came down! They’d cry for lustra! water, sulphur, piae, and lanrel.

V. 159. So changed are we, alas! Our arms are carried to the furthest North, butthose
