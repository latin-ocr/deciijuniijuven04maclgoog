SATIRA III. 43

and tells his reasons for leaving his native place. No honest man can thrive there, he
says ; the town is overrun with cunning foreigners and upstarts who have trickedtbem·
selvas into riches and influense, making themselves necessary to familias and getting their
masters' secrete. The poor too have no chance, and poverty apes wealth ; every thing

. hastobe bought, and every thingisdear. There are lires and falling bouses, and even

these are only ruinousto the poor: the rich helpone another, while the poor manetarves.
The noises st night are such that no one can sleep, at least no poor man in the lodging·
honses. The rich man rides safely through the streete, while the poor is elbowed by the
crowd, and has a good chance of being killed by great beanrsend stenes, or by pots from
the upper s tories, and so forth, or by some druuken brawler who picks a qnarrel wrt thhim,
or by robbers who break into his house at night.

There are some parts of the satire which remind the reader of Horace's style; parti·
cularly the quamt descript1on ofa poor man 'senconnterwit tab drunken bully who, after
beating his victim savagely, snmmons him for au assault.

Umbricius' 1s any body. There was an ‘’haruspex oi that name, of whom Tacitus relatos
that be warned Galba of his fate. But there rs no sense in supposing him tohe theman.
It was a common name. The satire may have been written about the same time as the
last3 but it is impossible to say.

ARGUMENT.

'Ihongh Iam in despair at the loss of an old friend, Ioannot but commend Um·
bricius’ resolution to quit the town and go away to the pleasant shores of Cumae.
There ss no wildemess 1 would not myself prefer tot the dangers and annoyanoes of
this city.

V. 10. While his family and goods were all being packed' ιιι ιο οιιο οοιι, we stopped' ιιι

. the valley of Aegeria, whose wood rs let to beggarly Jews, and her native fonutnin
distlgured by art. And thus my friend began ι

V. 21. “ No room is here forvirtne, no retum for honest labonr ς audasI am getting poorer
every day, I mean to take myself to Cumae while 1 bave any vigour len. 1 bid my
native place farewelh let rogues live there, and by their dirty trades get rich; till
trumpeters shall rise to give the shows they once proclaimed, and get monopolies of
every thing, raised high by fortune in her merry moods. What can I do at Rome? not
lie, or praise poor books, or tell the stars, or search the insides of trogs. I am nopimp
or thief. So all avoid me as a useless limb. 'Nono bnt accomplices are patronized,
with horrid secrete buruing in their bosoms. The thief loves him who can accuse
him when he pleases. No gold will pay you for the wretched uights it coste you to
be feared of your great friend.

V. 58. “The town is overrun with Greeks3 and worse, Syria has poured her refuse into
Rome-her langnrge eustoms, harps, and drums, and barlots. Away all ye who love
the turbsned strumpets! Thy hardy sons, Quirinus, pnt on Greek shoes, and gresso
their necks for the ‘palaestra' From every town they swarm and creep into rich
honses-clever, abandoned, impudent, prompt, fluent. What should you say that man
was? Any thing you plesse, nil arts and sciences he knows, the starveling Greek
will put ou wings if yon bid him—for Daedalus was a Greek, and born at Athens.

V. 81. “ What, must I not avoid their purple i shall that man rank before me who came

. to us with the plums and fige? Have I not breathed from infancy the air of Rome,
and is that nothing? These flatterers by trade know how to gain belief when they

praise a blockbead's talents, and a plain man's face, long neck, and squeaking voice.
lf I should praise them, no one would believe me. Their ecting is quite perfect 3 their
whole tribe are players. Yon langh, theylangh still londer i you weep, they weep bnt
grieve not 3 eall for a lire, they’ll get their cloak3 say you it's hot, they sweat. So
