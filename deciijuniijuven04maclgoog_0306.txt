Exta et candiduli divina tomacula porci, ’ 355
Orandum est ut sit mens sana incorpore sano:
Fortem posce animum mortis terrore carentem,
Qui spatium vitae extremum inter munera ponat

Nesciat irasci, cupiat nihil, et potior'es
Herculis aerumnas credat saevosque labores
Et Venere et coenis et pluma Sardanapali.
Monstro quod ipse tibi possis dare: semita certe
Tranquillae per virtutem patet unica vitae.
Nullum numen abest si sit Prudentia: nos te, 365
Nos facimus, Fortuna, deam caeloqu'e locamus.
