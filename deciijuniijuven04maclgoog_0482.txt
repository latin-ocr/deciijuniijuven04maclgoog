SATIRA VI.

INTRODUOTION.

Pnnsnrs’ 1001 satire, like Juvenal’s, 10 a fragment. 'l'hat he wrote slowly, as the
Grammarian says, may be easily believed, und his early death may have overtaken him
before he had timeto finish this 000111. This would give itan interest which in itself
it has not.
η ’1110 0001 has retired for the winter 10 the coast, and is living on the shores of the
Gulf of Spezia (Lunaeportus), where, if the Scholiast is to be believed, his mother
lived after her second marriage. He 0110 down to write to his friend Caesius Bassus,
the lyric poet3 and after paying a high compliment to his genius, he commenda the
climate and soenery and retirement of the place he is staying at. There he lives free
from all anxiety and all jealousy of his neighbours' prosperity. He contrasts liis own
state of mind with that 01 men, on the one haud, who deny themselves the necessaries
01 life, and, on the other, who run through their estate 111 their youth with riotous
living. He expresses his resolution to enjoy what he has got, and advises all men 10
deal liberally vvith their means, living up 10 their income, and being ready to help
a friend 111 111110 01 need, even 01 the sacrifice 01 0011 01111011001010. This suggestion
. brings up the principal subJect of the satire, which is the folly 01 those who deny
themselves for the sake 01 their 110110, 0 favouritc subject with Horace. Whether it
was the poet’s intention 10 continue that subject 10 the end 01 the satire, 01 10 put in
any other point 01 view the spirit 01 money-getting, it is impossible 10 say. But
Iam surprised that casaubon, Jahn, and others should treat thc satire as an entire
composition. Itis manifestly unflnished, and so the Grammarian’s memoir ex·
pressly states.
Of Caesius Bassus not much 10 known. He was a lyric poet, and Persius, with the
partiality ofa friend, speaks highly of his poems. But Quintilian had no great opinion
