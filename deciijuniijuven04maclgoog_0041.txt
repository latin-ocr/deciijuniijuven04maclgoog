xxxvi INTRODUCTION.

to be interpolatione, and his judgment on them may be vidwed ae a
challenge to all those who maintain that they are genuine. His repu-
tatiou as a critic will depend on his success or failure in establishing
his opinion. The fourth Satira, as it stands, hae an introduction of
thirty-six verses, which have been added, as Ribbeck assumes, by
somc unskilful hand. He is not the first critic or reader who hae felt
some surprise at finding a long Prologue to nothing, for the first thirty-
six lines have no connexion with the real subject of the Satire, though
there are critice who admire this vPrologue and think it is appro-
priate and a fine piace of composition. The beginning of the Prologue
announcee that Crispinus is again brought on the stage, and the writer

declares hie intention to summan him often to play his part. We ἦ
expect that we are going to read a terrible invective against the fellow3 ¹
but after a few general remarks about his villany, we are told that the Ἴ

present Satire will only treat of his smaller offences, and then comes the
particular charge against him of buying a fish at an enormous price,
and eating it himself. The mention of the fish is supposed by the
admirere of the Prologue to be a clover way of connecting the intro-
duction with the real Satire, the subject of which is the great fish that
was presented to Domitian. But what becomes of Crispinus after this
fiourish? He plays a most insignificaut part in the scene before the
Emperor, and says not a word about the big fieb, though something
would have been very much to the purpose from a man who was a
buyer of fish, and in his early days cried them· through the streete of
Rome. If Juvenal wrote this Prologue to the Satine, we cannot
commend his taste. Ribbeck goes into particulare, and examines
various parte of thie Prologuein order to confirm his general con·
damnationes it.

The other long passage, which Ribbeck treats as an interpolation, ie
the Introduction of fifty-five lines vvhieh is prefixed to the eleventh

Satira. Thie Introduction resembles that to the fourth Satire in thie Χ

respect, that if you cut it off, you lose nothing of the real Satira, which

is an invitation to a friend to come and dine with Juvenal. This·

friendly epietle is a charming composition, and reminds us, as Ribbeck
observes, of Horace's humour and genial temper. If Juvenal wrote tha
Prologue, he would have done better if he had commenced his epietle
at once without a preface.

This Essay also contains a short chapter on verses which have been
transposed in Juvenal’s text, and on the passages wherc something
appears to have been lost. The laet chapter, written in Latin, is on
the famous sixth Satire, the disorderly arrangement of which the learned
critic hae attempted to correct.

This ingenious Essay contains matter which a future editor of Juvenal
