SATIRA I.

INTRODUOTION.

'l'n1s satire, for reasons stated iu v. 47, could not have been written before s.1>.100
and was probably not written long 11111 that dato. Heinrich, whose judgment I have
agraet respect for, says itis not so much asatire as s prefaoe or introduction to avolume
of satiras. It is certainlya satire as severe as any in the hook. Juvenal had probably
written others before it, but Ido not ses enough in this poem to entitle it to be called a
preface. He says all the passione of men from the flood dowuwnrds arethe hodge·p0dge
of his book-“ nostri farrago libelli ’' (v. 86)-11111 he has touched upon a good many of
thamin this satire, which may be the ‘libellus ’ he means. 11 not, hs musthave been
intending to publish acollection 3 for ⁴ libellus' must mean something definite, either oue
poem or a collection. He begins with supposing himself persuaded by some person not
to write, as Horace pretends with Trebatius (sii. 1). But the times arc such, he says,
that he cannot help it 3 and while there are so many indifferent poete sponting their lines
every where, he may es wcll write esothers. He then goes into a detail of some of the
vile features of society3 among which are the voluntery degradation of womeu3 their
lewdness3 tha preferment of eleves and insonuere 3 the impunity of robbers, and forgers,
aad morderers3 men selling the honour of their wives 3 women pcisoning their husbands 3
incest and adultery undisguised3 avarica, gambling, extravagante, gluttony 3 the con·
tempt and neglect of the poor by the rich 3 magistrates degradad into beggars. The burst
about thepoets and their recitatione isoulya way of introducing humorously the graver
matters thot follow. A good deal of what was recited was no doubt bad enough3 but
Juvenal's quamsi was not with his literary brethrsn, whose causa he takes up, as well
as their recitatione, in the seventh satire. They bave in reality nothing todo with the
. satire as such, though Juvenal pretends they have. The arguments prefixed to the MSS.
treet this satire as a preface to the rest. Ruperti, on the other hand, thinks it was
written before all the others, and Dryden that it is “the natural groundwork of all the
rest 3'' for “ hersin he confines himselfto no one subJ'ect, but strikes indifferently at
all men in his way 3 in every following satire he has chosen some particular moral which
he would inculcate, and lashes some particular vice 01· folly.'' Isca noproofs oneway or
the other. It might have been written first or lastfor any evidence I can find in the poem
itself, irrespective of tha sign of the date noticed above, which puts itlater perhaps than
soma
