SATIRA ΙΙ.

Haec emis hirsuto spirant opobalsama collo
Quae tibi? Ne pudeat dominum monstrare tabernae.
Quod si vexantur leges ac jura, citari

, Ante omnes debet Scantinia. Respice primum
Et scrutare viros 3 faciunt hi plura: sed illos 45
Defendit numerus junctaeque umbone phalanges
Magna inter molles concordia. Non erit ullum
Exemplum in nostro tam detestabile sexu.
'Pedia non lambit Cluviam, nee Flora Catullam:
Hispo subit juvenes et morbo pallet utroque. 50
Numquid nos agimus causas, civilia jura
Novimus, aut ullo strepitu fora vestra movemus?
