Tms satire is said by Heinrich not 11 11 found iu two MSS. of Copenhagen. Lubinus
(1603) says of it, “Nec desunt qui hanc Satyrum Juvenslis esse negent cum in anti·
quissimis codicibus 111 inveniatur. Aliter sentit magnus ille Scaliger filius (J osepb)
ut praesenti mihi quondam ipse indicavit.’' Hedoes not say by whom its absence from

before the ssttcenth satire. currenni (about 1110) a contemporary of Vella says,
“Penultimo loco haec Satira edita est a Juvenuli, sed librariorum culpa in finem
translata 3 quem errorem ex codicibus antiquis 111111 dignoscas? Ruperti tells us Valla
says it is wanting in the oldest Mus„ but does not rerer us to un place where he says
so. Caspai Barthius (1021) quotes from a MS. ol his: “ Setina bsecncn postremo editt
est a Juvenule sed ordo debet esse ut 111111 sequatur praecedens. Juvenulis enims
l'uridein exilium extrusus nou videtur sibi male esse. Ilrgc laudat militiam. Quidam
dicunt nouessa luvenalis sed sb 1311111111 appositam.” Barthius udde, “Nos siquis
senteutiam rogarit dicemus luvenalis plane non esse, 111 ecem autem opinione fuit
olim Aug. Decembrius estque‘hodie J. Rutgsrsius ” (bustu Adr. xiv. 16). 'l'he Scho·
Iiust of Pithoeus says, “ Ista aplerisquc exploditur et diciturnon cese luvenalis.” Suri.
ι. 2 is quoted by Priscian, and v. 6 and 42 by Servius. The former lived about the

middle 11111 tuh century, and the latter rather earlier: the commentar-y (on Virgili

the satire must hare been extant in Priscian's time and supposed by him to 11 J ureusl's.
Some parts of the Scholia of Pithoeus were written by one who was not a Christisn
(aee note on xiv. 103), and for this reason ure supposed to be earlier than Constantina
(11. 306). But other parts urs. by luter hands, and the Scholium ebore mentioned is
111 to be implicitly relied upon as of great antiquity. Jahn quotes a Seboliunr οιι s
