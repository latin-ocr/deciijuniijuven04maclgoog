LIFE OF PERSIUS. nix

The former is supposed to be the subject, with his wife Myutale, 01
an epitaph of four lines on a ‘cippus' preserved among the Anmdel
marbles, with the heada 01 an elderly man and woman ¹. Both these
persons were Greeks, connected, as is clear from the gentilician names
they bore, with Roman families 01 distinction.

Paetus Tmasea is mentioned by Juvenal, with his son·in·law, Helvidius
Priscus (S. v. 36). His character was that of an honest man in times
of the worst corruption, and his affection for Persius, which the Gram-
marian says lasted nearly ten years, and therefore only ended with his
death (for Thrasea survived him four years), was a strong testimony to
the poet's goodness. Itis said they sometimes travelled together, but
we are not told where they travelled. There is no trace iu the writings
of Persius of his having been out 01 Italy. Thrasea was put to death with
scarcely the shadow 01 a pretext, ab. 66. The Senate condemned him
under compulsion. .

Arria, the wife of Thrasea, was the daughter of Arria mentioued
above, and it was for her Persius wrote the lines on her mother's death
which were destroyed with his other juvenile productione. The relation·
ship between Arria and Persius is not known.

His father, it appears, left a sister, and it would seem that she lived
with her sister-in·law after Flaccus’ death. According to the amended
text of the life Persius had an only sister. It does not appear whether
his mother had any family by her second marriage. His love for these
ladies and his dutiful attention to them are represented as most exem· ¹
plary, and to their society no doubt, as Jahn says, he owed much of that
maidenly modesty and gentlenesa of character which the Grammarian
attributes to him. That he was carefully watched and kept from tempta·
tion in boyhood may be inferred from what he says to Cornutus, S. v, 32,
sqq, and the same care was shown in the selection of that good man
for his toacher. His father when he died left him under a ‘tutor,'
whose name is not mentioned, but who there is every reason to sup·

pose discharged his trust faithfully, for Persius died rich, leaving
his mother and sister between them two milliona of sesterces¹ in ready
money.

His death took place 011 the 24111 November, Am. 62, at his own
country house, eight miles from Rome, on the Appian roed, which was
so lined with the villas 01 wealthy Romans that Bovillae, four miles
further on, was sometimes called a suburb. (See note on S. vi. 52.)
