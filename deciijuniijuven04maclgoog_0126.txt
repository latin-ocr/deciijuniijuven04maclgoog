SATIRA lv.

INTRODUOTION.

rna man Crispinus mentioned in the first satire (v. 26) as a eoxcombwho had been im·
ported a slave, and had risen to consequence by the favour of Domitian, is here introduced
again. A piece of extravagance of his is'made the handle for introducing the story of a
fish of immense aize which was once caught in the Adriatic, and presented hythe fisher·
man ιο Domitian at his country palace on the Alban lake. The tyrant, by way of
showing his contempt for the senate, summoned them suddenly, a's if on matters of state,
to attend him from Rome, for the purpose of giving their opinions upon the fish and the
manner of dressing it. The satire turns upon this point, the degradatiou of the senators,
some of them honourable men, whom, as well aa others who were not so, he mentions by
name. The poem was written aiter the death of Domitian, which is referred ιο in the
lusttwo lines. It is difficult ιο say how soon after, but Crispinus still retained the
wealth he had acquired under Domitian, and we may believe it did not stay with him
'long under the next reigns. Tne sketches of the different senators are very good. Tbey
are evidently drawn from life, and no better scene was wanted or could be invented to
represent the abject condition of the priucipal men of Rome under this insolent tyrant.

ARGUMENT.

Crispinus here again—aud he must often play his part-monster, without a virtue
to redeam him. What use is all his weelth to him? The bad are never happy, much
less the adulterer and the incestuous. But now of smaller matters; though in another
this were had enough. But what is to be done where men areworsethan all that can
be said of thern? ,

V. 15. He bought a mullet of six pounds for as many sestertia: notas a presentior
some rich old man or for his mistress 3 no, he bought it for himself. He, the Egyp-
tian slave! a fish eost more thau the man that caught it, nay, more than an estate
in the provinces. What shall we think that emperors eat when such a side-dish
gorges the parasite of the court, now first of equites, who used to cry stale fish in his
native place?

V. 34. Let's sit, Galliop‘e ς tell atrue tale, ye Muses chaste and young: aud since 1 eall ‚
you so give me your favour.

V. 37. When our last Flavius was torturing the world, it happened a huge fish was
taken at Ancona, not less than they which after winter’s ice fleat from Maeotis ιο the
Euxine. Tne monster straight is marked for the high-priest, for who would dare to
sell it with the coast full of informers, ready ιο swear the fish was reared in the
imperial ponda, and must go back ιο its lord? They tell us ull that’s good in the sea
belongs to the privy pnrse, so it’s sent as a present in fear of confiscation.

V. to. The winter had set in3 the manin haste, as if 'twas summer and the fish would
spoil, makes for the palacc. And when he gete to the lakes where Vesta dwells,a
crowd admiring stopa him3 when it parts the doors ily open ; the senate waits with·
out. He's brought to the great man. “Accept (says-he) an offering too big for
private tables: make merry, eat, this fish was kept for Caesar’s days. Itseif was
anxious ιο be caught.” The flattery is too gross, and yet his feathers rise; greatness
will swallow any thing. But now there is no dish to hold the monster. Solve calls a
eouucil of the men he hates, and on whose faces sit the terrers of a great man’s
friendship.
