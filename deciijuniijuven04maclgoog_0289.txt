240. D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Et nimias poscebat opes, numerosa parabat
Excelsae turris tabulata, unde altior esset
Casus et impulsae praeceps immane ruinae.
Quid Crassos, quid Pompeios evertit, stillum
Ad sua qui domitos deduxit flagra Quirites?
Summus nempe locus nulla non artepetitus, llo
Magnaque numinibus vota exaudita malignis.
Ad generum Cereris sine caede et'vulnere pauci
Descendunt reges et sicca morte tyranni.
Eloquium ae famam Demosthenis aut Ciceronis
, Incipit optare et totis Quinquatribus optat, 115
Quisquis adhuc uno partam colit asse Minervam,
Quem sequitur eustos angustae vernula capsae.
