D. JUNlI JUVENALIS

Unguibus ‘a saeva fertur grue. Si videas hoc 170
Gentibus in nostris, risu quatiere: sed illic,
Quanquam eadem assidue spectentur proelia, ridet
Nemo, ubi tota cohors pede non est altior uno.

“ Nullane perjuri capitis fraudisque nefandae
Poena erit?” Abreptum crede hunc graviore catena 175
Protinus et nostro (quid plus velit irai) necari .
Arbitrio ; manet ills tamen jactura, necunquam
Depositum tibi sospes crit, sed corpore trunco
Invidiosa dabit minimus solatia sanguis.
“At vindicta bonum vita jucundius ipsa.''
Nempe hoc indocti, quorum praecordia nullis
Interdum aut levibus videas flagrantia causis.
Quantulacunque adeo est occasio, sufficit irae.
Chrysippus non dicet idem nec mite Thaletis
