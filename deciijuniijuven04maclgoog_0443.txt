394 . A. PERSII FLACCI

Da pecus et gregibus fctuml’ Quo, pessime, pacto,
Tot tibi cum in flammas junicum omenta liquescant?
Et tamen hie extis et opimo vincere ferto
Intendit: ‘J am erescit ager, jam crescit ovile,
J am dabitur, jam, jam,’ donec deceptus et exspes 50
Nequicquam fundo suspiret nummus in imo.
Si tibi crateras argenti incusaque pingui
Auro dona feram, sudes aspectare laevo
Excutiat guttas laetari praetrepidum cor.
Hinc illud subiit auro sacras quod ovato
Perducis facies : nam fratres inter ahenos
Somnia pituita qui purgatissima mittunt
Praecipui sunto, sitque illis aurea barba.
Aurum vasa Numae Saturniaque impulit aera,

Vestalesque urnas et Tuscum fictile mutat. 60
