Bad acte 1111111111, the dcere. conscience convicte them though the praeconsumere
false. all your friends feel with you ; you 111 not 11 poor thet you should sink with
xsuch a loss ς besides the case is common, one out of fortune’s heap. Put offexeessive
grief: the sorrow of 1 man should not bleze up too high, the pnin should notbegreater

’ than the wound. Atride, emere seraper* ill you scarcecnn'bear, and ull your entreils

V. 23. No day 11 holy but 11 puts forth thieves and 11111. The good are rere, not
more then gates of Thebes or mouths of Nile. We live in the uinth ege, an ege so
bed no metnl is so base that it should give ite name. And yet we eall upon the fsith
of gods and men as loudly as the cliente of Faesidius when he pleade.

V. 33. Say, nrt thou' 111 thy second childhood that thou knowest not the charmsoi other
people's money, or how they luugh at your simplicity, expecting sny man should

victime. Then was dishonesty 1 prodigy. ’Twss a great crime if youth rose not to

a trust but pay it beck entire, it ie more wonderful then 111 the prodigies that ever
were.

V. 71. Complaiu that you’ve been impiously cheated often sestertia! What ifI tell
of one who's lost two hundred, and another more theu he con cram into his chest?
''l'is easy to despice the witness cf the gods, if human there be none. See with what
voice aud face the mun denies it. He sweers by all the gods aud goddesses, their
bows, epeers, tridente, ell the srmoury of heaven, yea, he will bcil his son end eut him ·
pickled, if he be 1 father.
