110 D. JUNII JUVENALIS

from long peace: luxury broods over us, more pestilent than erma, to avenge the
conquered world. Luat hes been rampant ever since the poverty of Rome departed ς
'twas this brought Greece emongst us. 'Twas money gave us foreign habits, and
broke down the nge with seli-indulgence. For what care lust aud drunkenness
combined? See how the wentons sneer at modesty, und shnme her very altars
We all know the good goddess’ secret rites; how her mad voturies, drunk with wine
and 1111111111, whirl their locks, and cell upon Priapus. No acting then, but

¹ wentonness at which the blood of nge might warin again. 'l'hey 1111 formen-and
would that secred ritas were free from wickedness like this—but every one has heard
of him who 111 old days stole in where all thet’s male must hide its head: then who
dared pour contempt on sacred things? Now we've n Clodius for every altar.

V. nlo. “ Thon put e lock upon the women.’' Aye, but who shall watch the watchersl
'lhey are the first to fall. Highest and lowest, she who tramps the streets and she
who rides in litters, all ere frail.

V. 352. To see the gemes Ogulnia hires her clothes and every thing, for 111 111 fortune's
gone to smooth·cheeked athletos. They’re poor, bnt heve no care for that3 and
squander what a thrifty husband savos, end think that money grows like trees. They
never think how much their pleosures eost.

V. 379. Suppose she’s fond ο1 music, thero's no singer but she corrupts him ς 111
favourite's harp is always in her hand: she kisses it, and thinks 'tis him she holds in
her embraee. Some noble dame, they sey, with meel end wine esked 111 the gods
whether ber Pollio's harp might hope 10 vvin the prino. What more could she 11 111
husband or her children were adying? What, Jnnus, dost thou answer such 1
inquiries? Ye hevenotmuch todo theninthe skies. 3

V. 898. But let her be a singer rather than a masculine bold gossip‚ who talks among
the officere, knows 1111111111, public and private, waits at the gates to piek up the
first tidings from ebroad, end then distributos lies concerning lloods, and earthquahes,
and so forth to every woman that she meets in the town.

V. 412. But she's more bearable than savage women who flog their poorer neighbours,
and 11 a dog bnrks fly into 1 rege, and beat the beust und his owner. She goes at
night to tho bath, keeps her guests waiting for their dinner, then comes home 11111111
and thirsty‚ drinks off two pints and vomits them again to getan appetite. ’111
husband veils his eyes l'rom the sichening sight.

V. 434. But she is worse who when she goes to dinner begins forthwith commending
Virgil, comparing him with Homer. The learned hold their tongues, even the women
theim, while she clacks on like bells or basina when they're struck. No one need help
the moon with trumpet or with cymbnls3 she can deliver her without your aid. Your
learned woman oughtto wear short tunice, sacrifice to Silvanus, go and bathe with the
meu. Merry no woman who can talk, and arguo, and knows all knowledge. Ι hate
your women rhetorician who speaks by 11111, end recollects old verses 1 never heard 11,
end correcte the barbarisms of her friends. Preylets husband make mistakes some·
times.

V. 457. But most unbeerable of ull is she who decks herself abroad with jewels; 11
home her faceis all besmeared with bresd3 she washes for her lover. What does
she csrefor looking well 11 home? For parsmours she buys her nard and all the
perfumes of the East, softens her skin with asses’ milk, and takes the covering off that
hides her benuty. Α thing made up with drugs end poultices, what call ye it, 1 face
or sore?

V. 474. What do they do by day? 1f they get up cross, woe to the poor waiting-girl,
the toilette·men are stripped, the Liburnian smerts, one with the horrible scourge,
the other with the whip. Some keep the executioners in fec. And while the 11111
