doeenot amount in my opinion ιο sufficiam eridame against ιιι anthenticity cf the
satira. The only MSS. from which it is distinctly said tc be absent are the two
copenhagen noticed by Heinrich, who does not mention their ages. What Lubinus
'says is only repeated frum others, whom he does not name, while ifScaliger really said
tc leubinus what he attributes to him, his opinion must be allowed great weight. If he
did not, then Lubinua’ word is worth nothing. 'l'hc date of the principel Schclinm is
uncertain, and the observation it contains makes no reference ιο Mss.; and though
the Scholium shows that the satire was by many not thought tc be Juvenal’s, it does
not say on what monade they “exploded ’⁹ it. An opinion founded only on the merite
of a work like this would not be worth mors in the third century than now.

Τιιι ιιι poem is complete no one can say, whether it be J uvenal's or another’s,
and one who had set himself to imitate Juvenal, and had the ability to do it as well as
this writer, is not likely ιο have published a fragment ora composition so defective in
order and integrity as thie. I do not think with Heinrich that it is begging the question
to say it is only a fragment. Ιι seems ιο me impossible ιο view it in any other light
than that of an nnflnished poem¹ and 1 think it may very well have been a posthumous
publication of Juvenal's. I cannot otherwise account for its publication at all, for as e
whole itis without point3 while newertheless it contains some good writing worthy of
Juvenal, and might have been expanded, if ιιι author had finished it according to his
design, into a very amusing satire. thever the writer was, it is to be regretted for
historical purposes hadid not flnish his work, for it relates to a subject, Roman military
life, which is full of interest. .

Heinrich is right in saying that ιο jndge of ιιι anthenticity of a work by the style
and manner and language is unsafe, that the velue of such judgment depeuds ou the
capacity of the critic, and that it requires peculiar skill and natural instincte, which are
not common. But in this instance, where it is not denied by those who think Juvenal
may be the author that the work is not ln the state in which if he hed finished it we
should now have had it, this sort of sagacity is not wanted The satire is in a con·
dition in which uo author of sc mncb capacity would have given it to the world who
wished to gaiu reputaticn by it, and no author of reputatiou would have published it iu
his lifetime, though he might have made it known to his friends. The person who
wrote v. 7 (which Heinrich rejects without good reason) must have intended to write -
more on the subject that verse introducam and he who should bring in a single exam·
ple by au exordium plainly intended for several and not see that he was bungling, could
never have written the verses in which that example is set forth.

Ido not think then tharsis sufficient reason for supposing the fragment spurious, or
ιιι partini rejection of it in early times to have proceeded from any other cause than its
imperfect character.

The satire is in the form cf an epistle like the last, eud it professes ιο set forth the
advantages of a military life, looking at it as a young man might when tired of a
civilian's resbainta Of these advantages the writer instances ιιι liberty of the soldier
to secula a civilian without any fear of an action for damagcs, for the soldier can only
be tried in camp, and if a tcwnsman comes there for redress he may get a rude sort of
justice from a court-martial, but the whole campwill make him rue his revenge. iheu
justice in civil courte is attended with many delays, while in the camp it is prompt
and decisivo. Resides which a famer has no power over his son's military earnings, and
ιιι soldier can make a will of his own.

'l'his is literally the whole of the satire. It is as much a satire upon ιιι camp aethe
town, and sc probably it would have been carried ont in a variety cf comperimus
between cha soldier and civiliau. Assumiug Juvenal to be the author cf the satire wc
need not imagine (as the old commentatore did) any particular circumstances having
ςὶιιιι risa ts is. The suliect is one that might have suggested itself ιο any one, and
