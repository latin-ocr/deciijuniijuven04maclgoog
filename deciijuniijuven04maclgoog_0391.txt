He had no witness to support him; but my story,acrime uot known in all the traga-

dies, was acted publicly the other day. y
V. 32. Two neighbonring peoples‚ Ombites and Tentyrites, have long 1111011 out with

deadly hatred, only 101· thiatbat each maintsin there are no 011101· gods but those they
worship. It was a holiday at Ombi, a lit occasion for the enemy, who were resolved
to spoil their seven-days’ sport (for these barbarians via with 1110 infamans Canopus ia
good living) 1 aud they expected easy victory when thoy were dranched with wine. 01
000 1110111010 was dancing, tlowers, pertumes3 on 1110 other, hatred and an empty belly.
Pirst they begin abusing with hot conrage3 this is the trump 01 battle. Thau they
charge with mutual shout: their weapons ara their fists; scarce any 01100111 wereleft
without a wonnd, 01 any uose uubroken. Faces contuscd you’d 100 throughout tha
host, cheeks burst and bones all starting through the skin, lists reeking with the blood
01 eyes knocked ont. But this is child's play 1 what use is such a crowd 01 combatauts

if noue are killed? So they grow 101001 and throw stoues, not such as Turnus, aljar, ,

or Tydides threw, but such as men can wield iu these degenerata days, when all are
bad and puny, 10 that heaven laughs at men and hates them.
V. 72. But 10 return. One party reiuforced get bold aud ply the sword and bow, 1110

other fly and Tentyra pursues. One slips aud falls in his basto ; they take him pri· r

soner and cat him up audeat him raw. How lncky they profaned not the holy ele-
mcnt! I’m sare you must be happy it escaped! But they who 110 had neveramora
pleasant moal. Dou't think it was the 1111 11110 only that was swest; the last 11111
when the carcase was all gone scraped up the blood aad licked it from his fingcrs.

tune's spite aud warde extremity, a long blockade aud 11111110. Such cases wo should
pity, when after all their food is gone to the last blado of grass, men eat each other,
as they would themselves: these gods and men may pardon, 11 the ghosts would do

01 those they've 01101. Zeno may 1011011111 all things must not bc done even 101· 111ος ,

but how should they be Stoica, and that iu old Metellus' timei Now all 1110 world
have got our learning aud the Greek 100. Gaul lesches Britain how 10 plead aad
Thule talks 01 hiring soona rhetorician. But yet that noble people aud Saguntumhad
10110 excuse 101 what they did. But llgypt was more savage thau tho Tauria altam
forthere (11 we’re 10 trust the story) the goddess ouly sacrificedthe 111011 and nothing
more. What led these people 10 their crime, what accident, blockade, or 1111111101
Suppose tho Nile bad left the country dry, what gramm insult could they show thegodl
The Cimbri, Britones, and Scyt-hians wera never yet so savage as this useless cowardly
herd, who swarm upon the river in their painted boats. No punishment is hard
enough for those whose passion 11 11 bad as famine.

V. 131. Nature kas given 1010 hearts 10 men, 1110111 will prove. She bids us worp 101
friends iu 1011011, 101 the poor wretch on trial 1011111 1110, 01 boy that brings his
fraudnlsnt guardian to justice, whose weeping 1100 and streaming hair mightbea
girl's. She bida us wecp when a young maiden dies or little habe. What good man
andtrue but counts all human miserias his own? 'Tis this distinguishes us 1101111001
beasts; 101· this wa’va miuds to take in things divine aud exorciso all arts3 and 101110
from heaven, which they have 101 who look down on the earth. 'lhey've breath but
we bave spirit, so that sympathy bids us sack mutual help, J'oin in communities, aud
quit the woods our fathers lived in, build honses, join our hahitations 101 mutual
saiety, stand by 01011 other and protect the fallen, light altogether at ono signal, share
thc same walls and towers. But now the snakes are more harmonious thau we 11ος
tho wild beust preys not 011 his kind ι but as forman 'tis not enough to have forged
the fatal sword, though the tlrst smiths knew only to make tools. But now 110110
'whole peoples not content with killing in their-passion, but they must cat each othcr.
