ulra OF Pnusrus mi

a few passages, the Satires are aa free from difficulty as most of
Juvenal's‘.

They were much admired by the anciants⁶, and have been abun·
dantly quoted by Grammarians, by Fathers of the Church‚ and
mediaeval writers. If certain passages are less familiar to modern
ears than their fitness for quotation might lead us to expect, it is from
the difficulties of the poet1y‚ which have deterred men of our day from
reading it as it deserves. The subject of the first Satira, which deals
with tha vicious poetical taste of the day, and has many quotations from,
or imitatione of, tha verses of aerumpnam, writers, would be mora in· ,
ἰθτθεῐίης and intelligible when it was first published than it is to us,
and this Satira alone would create a larga demand for the volume. The
Epistle to Macrinus eomes more home to ourselves as dealing with the
worship of God, the selfish or worldly abusa of which is common to all
ages. Tha introduction Ι have prefixed to the third Satira may per·
haps lead some to read it with curiosity, and they will not be disap-
pointed. The more Ι read it, themora Iadmira it. Seis-ignorance is
a large subject, which might be better handled than it is in the fourth
Satira; and the folly of running after and hoerding money to be aquan-
dered by one's heirs is not done as much justice to in the sixth as it
probably would have been if the poet had finished it. The fifth is
generally considered the best in the book, though Ι myself prefer the
third. In the fifth there is that tribute to the goodness of Cornutus
which proves the goodness of the writer and the gracafulness with which
he could write. It also shows more of the philosophica] school in
which Persius had been trained, without however introducing any thing
more new than the Stoic doctrine that the only free man is the
saga, with which Cicero and Horace had before made their readers
familiar. There are more imitations of Horace in this Satira than in
any other.

A writer of satire may be ‘farus et violens' with his pen, and yet
very amiable in manners, as tha Grammarian describas Persius to have
been. He may also in those days have been chaste and modest, and yet
have used language for the exposure of vica which now cannot be used,
or even read without diseomfort. There is nothing in Persius' style to
contradict tha plaasing description given of him by his biographer, which
probably was quita true. More than one gem now in existence has

⁴ Jul. Scaliger thought Persius wrote obscurely on purpose that fools might admira
him. Ha is very severe on Persius. (See Scal. Poat. vi. c, 6, iii. c. 97.)
⁸ Quintilian (x. 1. 94) says, “Multum at verae gloriae, quamvis uno libro, Persius
meruit? Martia] ('v. 29) says, ,
“Saepius in libro numeratur Persius uuo
Quam levis in tota Marsus Amazonide.”
