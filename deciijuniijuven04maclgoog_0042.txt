must examine oarefully. I think that many of Ribbeck’s criticisms
on particular passages may be answered, but it seems to me impossible
to read the work of the so-called Declamator without feeling the great
differenoe between him and the writer of the ten undisputed Satires,

Whether that difference is best explained by assuming that we have
two writers under one name, or on some other hypothesis, is a matter
which every reader must determine for himself.

The peculias difficulty of Persius consists in the arrangement of the
dialogus or supposed dialogue. There are also a few passages which
perhaps no* editor has yet satisfactorily explained. I think Mr. Macleane
has handled the matter well, though he may be mistakeu sometimes.
I agree with what he says of Jahn's copious commentary. Jahn’s
edition is a most laborious and useful work, and' his commentary is full
of learning. But the good sense is not equal to the learning, and he is ¹
sometimes completely wrong in his explanation. Ι prefer Heinrich’s
briefer and less learned notes.
