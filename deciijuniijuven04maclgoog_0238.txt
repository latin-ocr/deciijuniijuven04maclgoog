V. 39. This is for you, Rubellius Plautus, swelling with your descent from Drusus, as
if it were a merit of your own that you were born not of a poor weaver ιιι of the
great lulus' blood. “Low wretches (say yon), ye who cannot tell your father's
birthplace. I cm a son ol Cecrops 1 '’ Long may you live ιο enjoy your birth! But
in that low rabble you will find a man of eloquence‚ who shall defend some noble
blockhead, or solve the riddles of the law 3 and some breve soldiers too ; while you are
all Cecropisn, as useless as a Hermes 3 the only differenoe is his he'ad’s of marble,
yours has life in it. Tell me, Ο Trojan, who oounts animala noble except they’re
bravo? We praise a horse for speed who has won many rsces easily. Wherever he
was reared we call him noble who beats the rest, while e mere bord to be put np end
sold are the best bred if they but seldom win. There we have no respect for
ancestry z they sell for little and go ιο drew acart orgrind a mill. So tell me some.
thing of your own ιο engrave upon your bnst, besides the honours that we freely
give to those to whom you owe all ιιιι you have.

V. 71. Enough for him, who lacking oommon sense (rare in that state of life) is pnffed
with his relationship to Nero, But you, my friendl would not have yon velued
upon the merite of your family, and you yourself do nothing forfnture time to praise.
”Iis poor ιο rest upon anothe1²s fame 3 remove the pillarnnd the roof falls in ; robbed
of its elm the wine eomes ιο the ground. Be a good soldier, honest guardian, upright
judge, witness inflexihle, count not your life before your character, your life before
the cause for which yon live. Τιιι man deserves ιο die, though he fare sumptuously
and smell of all perfumes.

V. 87. When you have got the province that you look for, put reins upon your tempor
and desires 3 pity the poor natives3 the princes you will see have ell the marrow
sncked from out their bones. Τιὶιι of the laws, the trust committed to you, the ,
honours that await the good, the fate of those who were condemned for robbing the
Cilicians Not that such condemnationis worth much, when one takes what another
leaves. Ge, get an auctioneer ιο sall your clothes, Chaerippus, and straight say
nothing3 it were mere madness ιο throw away your fare besides.. 'lhose people
suffered less when they were beaten first: riches were leo them still, shawls and
dresses, picturas and statues, and chased silver vessels ; then came your governors
and carried off more spoils thom pesce than eser graced a triumph. Now the little
that they have they’ll lose it all. Yon may despise perhaps the Rhodians and Corinth
too; but take good care of Spain, of Gaul, Illyricum, the Afrieens who send us corn
to feed our idleness. Besides they’ve nothing to repay you, Marius has robbed them.

still will leave them arms. ,

V. 125.„This is no saw ς believe the Sibyl speaks Be your attendants righteous, no
favourite sell your judgments, your wife ιο harpy, then you may trace your birth ιο
Picus and the Titan brood, and clsim Prometheus lor your ancestor. But if ambition,
lust, and cruelty carry you headlong, then your ancoetms only hold np the torch to
expose your shame. The sinis greatest in the greatest sinner. Why boast yoursell'
to me, you who forge wills in temples which your grandsire built, before your fathers
statae, and steal by night to an adulterous bed?

V. 147. ιιι consul Lateranus drires his coach right pest the ashes of his sires by night,
but the moon und stars look on, and when his consulship is done he'll do it in broad
day and meet his sged friend without a blush. He’ll do grooms' work, und when he
goes to sacrifice to Jove he'll swesr by Epona and stable gods. And when he goes to
taverns the greasy host comes out to meet him, end with an air salutes his lordship ς
while the officious hostess brings the wine.
