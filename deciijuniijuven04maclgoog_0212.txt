will get no more But see how much the music master gets, and laugha at Theodorus.
He bnilds him costlyheths and porticoes to ride in when it ruins. What, must hs
wait till the slry clears and go and splash in the naudi And then a dining-room on
marble pillars. thtsver his house costa, he hus his hutlers and his cocks besides.
Meanwhile Quintilian geta his two sestertia, and that a splendid fea! 'l'here’s
nothing a father will not pay for more than his son. How then isQuintilian so rich?
Heia an exception: a lucky man is every thing that's psat, and good, and wisa ς a
senator, an orator, though he's hoarse his voiccis still divine. It makes a difference
under what star you're horn. Fortem can make a rhetorician conari, and il she
plesse a couud rhotorioian. What was Ventidius, what Tullius? what bnt a stur
and influence of hidden destinyl’ Fate gave a slave a kingdom and a prisoner
triumphs. But he was lucky, rare as a white raven. Many get tired of the fruitless
aunem cheir, witness Carinas and Thrasymachus: he too was poor to whom Athens

know history md all authors as well as the nuils on his hand3 so that at any moment
he can tell who was Anchises' nurse, who and whence Archemorns' stepmother, how
long Acestes lived, and how much wine he gave the Phrygiam. Requirc that he
shall mould his pnpils' morals as a man makes a tace of wax, and he then‘facher and
keep their tugers from foul„ practices (though he may say, it is no easy matter to
watch the hands and eyes of all those boys). This do, says one, and when the year
