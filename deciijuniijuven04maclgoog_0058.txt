SATIRA Ι.

Haec ego non agitem? Sed quid magis Heracleas ”
Aur Diomedeas aut mugitum Labyrinthi

· Et mare percussum puero fabrumque volantem,
Quum leno accipiat moechi bona, si capiendi 55 ·
J us nullum uxori, doctus spectare lacunar,
Doctus et ad calicem vigilanti stertere naso,·
Quum fas esse putet curam spectare cohortis
Qui bona donavit praesepibus et caret omni

· Majorum censu dum pervolat'axe citato
Flaminiam puer? Automedon nam lora tenebat
Ipse lacernatae quum se jactaret amicae.
Nonne libet medio ceras implere capaces
