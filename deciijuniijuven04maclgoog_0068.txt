SATIRA I.

Antiquis una comedunt patrimonia mensa. ·

Nullus jam parasitus erit: sed quis ferat istas

Luxuriae sordes? Quanta est gula quae sibi totos 140
Ponit apros, animal propter convivia natuml

Poena tamen praesens, quum tu deponis amictus
Tuigidus et crudum pavonem in balnea portas.

Hinc subitae mortes atque intestata senectus.

Ducitur iratis plaudendum funus amicis.

Nil erit ulterius quod nostris moribus addat
Posteritas; eadem cupient facientque ¹minores;
Omne in praecipiti vitium stetit. Utere velis,
Totos pande sinus, Dicas hic forsitan, Unde 150
Ingenium par materiae? unde illa priorum
Scribendi quodcunque'animo flagrante liberet
