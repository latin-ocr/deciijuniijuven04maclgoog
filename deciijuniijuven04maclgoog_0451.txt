402 A. PERSII FLACCI

Scire, erat in voto; demirosa canicula quantum

Raderet3 angustae eollo non fallier oroae; 50

Osoitat hesternum, dissutis undique malis.

Est aliquid quo tendis et in qnod dirigis arcum? 60
An passim sequeris corvos testaque lutoque

Securus quo pes ferat, atque ex tempore vivis?
