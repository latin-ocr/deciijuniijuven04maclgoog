Llrn OF JUVENAL. xv

that the emperor in a despateh addressed to him with the army, wrote
these words, “et te Philomela promovit'’ (alluding to his own epigram),
arrd that, learning from this the anger of the emperor, he died of a
broken beart.

The sixth mernoir makes Trajan the emperor, Paris being still the
bero of the epigram, and agrees with the fifth about Seotland.

Α seventh agrees substantially with the first, except that the emperor
is said to have been Nero,

These seven are published at the end of Jahn’s edition.

It seems clear that not one of these notices is original. They have
come, and that not at first hand probably, from two or three common
stocks, which have been confounded according to the fancy of the
writer3 and whatever amount of truth there may have been in the
originale has been perverted and confused in the later editions, which
show very little evidence of accurate information.

The only authority for Juvenal'a birthplaoe contained in his poems is
in Sat. iii. 319, where his friend says, “quoties te Roma tuo refici pro-
perantem reddet Aquino.” But this only shows that Juvenal was in
the habit of frequenting thet town. Persius (S. vi. 7) speaks 'of the sea
on the Ligurian coast as ‘meum mare,' because he was staying there at
the time, butno one now infers from this that he was born on that
uust‘. Where Juvenal was born therefore is uncertain ⁴, and the
time of his birth is equally so.

eighth (v. 120) to the crimes and banishment of Marius Priscus, whose

¹ exile took place nn. 100.

⁴ Another proof is that, in Sat xii. 75, he refers to the inner basin of
the Portus Augusti, constructed by Trajan. [If Juvenal wrote this
Sstire, the conclusion from the text is true ; and if he did not, the passage
still proves that this Satira was written after Trajan’s port was
amurcae] ,

Irr Sat vi. 502, there is an allusion to the way ladies wore their hair, .
which seems to show that this Satire was written in the reign of Trajan,
or early in tbut of Hadrian (see nete). .

In v. 407 of the same Satire, Lipsius hanes a reference to the reduc-
tion of Armenia to the condition of a Roman province, by the same
emperor, in nn. 106. This argument however has not much force.
