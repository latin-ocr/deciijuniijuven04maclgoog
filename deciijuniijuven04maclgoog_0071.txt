SATIRA ΙΙ.

INTRODUOTION.
'frus satire is lavelled at those persons in the upper ranhs of society (and particularly

it would seem at the Emperor Domitian) who, pretending a stoical virtue and crying
out against vice and calling np stringent old laws against it, were themselves practising
the worst vices in secret, and giving to the agea character which never had been equalled,
and could never be surpassed, for· debaucbery of the filtbiest kind. The Commentators
have generally supposed the Satira to be aimed attha professional philosophare of
the day. “ 'l'he poet in this Satyr inveighs against the Hypocrisie of the Philosophers
and Priests of his time,’' isTate's account of the argument. What his notione of a
Roman priest may have been it is hard to say, but he writes:

“When hypocritas read lecturas, and a sot,
Because into a Gown and Pulpit got,
Tho' surfeit·gorged and reehing from tbe Stews,
Nothing but Abstinence for’s theme will chuse.”

Heinrich, in edissertation of much sagacity, has shown that J uvenal’s meaning is very
different from this, and the scope of the poem more wide and important. 'l'he vices and
hypocrisy of Domitian wera imitated by the respectable people, and at these he aima hia
invectivas. κ

From the word ‘nuper' in v. 29, it has been inferred that the satire was written soon
after the events there referred to, which took place au. 83. ‘Nuper’ admits a good
deal of latitude, as it often does in Cicero, but it is reasonable to suppose that Juvenal
wrote while the matter was pretty fresh; and as the satire clearly has reference to the
time of Domitian, that it was written before his reign was over. Domitian was
assassiuated in September, A. 1). 96. Itis not very likely that he gave it much
publicity while the tyrant was alive.

For indignant power there is none of the poems that excels this. The nature of the
subyects however readers it almost uureadable, and nothing but the honesty of the
writer could make the task of editing it endurable. Whoever would judge of the
difference between the spirit of true indignation and that of a weak or impure mind in
dealing with such painful subjecta, should compare Juvenal with his translator Tate,
who has taken from the satire the hest recommendatiou it has, which is the virtue of
the author. If the psalm-translator and poet-laureata was a man of purity, he has done
himself injustice. The other translatore have executed their task better in this respect.

ARGUMENT.

I would gladly run to the utmost North when canting hypocritas dare talk of morale,
mere ignorant fellows, though they fill their shelves with busts. No faith is in their
outside. The whole town is teeming with these solemn villains. What, you reprove
vice, the foulest of all foul pretenders! They affect few words, and silence, and
cropped hair 3 more honest faris Peribomius, whomakes nosceret of his sin. I leave
him to hisdestiny3 Ipity him. But they are worst who with fine words attack such
vices. “I am no worse than you,'' says Varillus the degraded. Let the straight·
limbed laugh at the bandy-legged‚ thefair at the blackamoor. For who would tolerate
the Gracchi complaining of sedition, nor exclaim if Verres should affect to hate a thicf,
Milo a mmdcrer, Clodius an adulterer, Catilina Cethegus, or Sulla's pupils carp at
his proscriptioni But such was he who, while his fatal incest was in the doing, and
while his niece was spewning har abortiens, restored the bitterest laws against adultery.
