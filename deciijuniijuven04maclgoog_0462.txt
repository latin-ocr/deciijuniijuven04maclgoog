INTRODUC'I'ION.

1.. 6111111100 Ceraunus, to whom this satire is addressed, as stated in 6110 Introduction,
was the instructor 06 Persius, who went to him as soon as he came to mau’s estate, to
learn the Stoic philosophy. He was anative of one 06 6110 two places iu Libya named
Leptis (Κορνοῦτος deniers φιλόσοφος· ἡ 61661111 scarensem. Suidas, Κορνοῦτος).

there were many wealthy branchos. Seneca was one of thern, and was a friend of
Cornutus. ’6110 poet Lucan aas an Annaeus, and one of his pupils. Ilion Cassius
(62, c. 29) says that Nero, intending to write a Roman history in Epic verse, consulted
Cornutus as tc the number of books it should be in. Some of his flatterers told him they
should be four hundred, but Cornutus said no one would read them. And when some
oue said Chrysippus, tho Stoic, bad written many more, Cornutus auswcred that his
books bad something useful iu thern for human life. Whereupon Nero saut him into
exile. 'l'bis must have been after the death of Persius, aa). 62. According to Jerome
it was iu 68, 6110 11106 year 06 Nero's reign, [but according to Dion it was before the
consulship of Telesinus, aud therefore before ao. 66.]

'lhe Satira turns upon the character aud tcaching 06 Cornutus. It is supposed to be
delivered in conversation with him, and the introduction is well arranged. Persius
begins by referring to the commouplace 06 poeto aslring the Musa 601· abundred tongues;
and Cornutus ashs what he can be about, and hopes he is not going to write atragedy
or au Epic poem. He auswers that hc wauts this gift 06 tongues 60 6011 his affection
aud gratitude towards his friend and teacher, whom he addresses in affectionate lau·
guagc, declaring that their fates are the sarne, and their lives under the protectiou of
the same star. He contrasts the caruest life 06 his master, devoted to study and to
the instruction 06 660 young, with tho various seltlsh pursnits of the world ς aud he
tales that opportunity to urge upon old and young the study of philosophy. One of
the tencts of the Stoics is 61106 which is dwclt upon at length in the scveuth satire of
Horaoe's second 60011, and iu the 6661106 Cicero's Paradene, of which the title is 611
1601110001 ἐλεύθερος nal πᾶς ἄφρων δοῦλος. Taking up this doctrine Persius occupiee
the rest 061110 Satira with illustratione of it, showing that real liberty is not that 06
610 slave set free by the Praetor, though with his freedom he may get the world to
worship him, aud fancy he is at liberty 60 live as hc pleases. These notions he treats
as old wives' tales 3 for the Prtetor cannot teach a man the duties 06 1160 and how to
enjoy it, any more thau he can teaeh a low fellow to play the har-p. Δ 01011 cannot do
what he pleases, for he can only do what he is 66 for. If he isupright, suddisoerning,
and just, and modefate, and kind, aud liberal without extravagance, and free from
avarice, he is a freeman; but if not, he is as much ⁸a slave as the man that carries his
maure things 60 660 60611, and is flogged if he luiters on the way. There arc those,
