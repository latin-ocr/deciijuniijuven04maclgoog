nothing to recommend him. He has horrowed without acknow·
ledgment from Ruperti; so at least that editor says. His remarks·

are very feeble. He has added in a separate volume notes more
valuable than his own by the two brothers Valesii, written at the

end of the seventeenth century, but never before published entire.

Hc also had access to a large number of MSS. in the imperial
library at Paris. How he used them his referen'ces are too general
to enable the reader to judge. 'l'he only English edition I have had
occasion to notice is one by Mr. Mayor (Cambridge, 1853), intended
for the use of schools 3 the chief feature of which is a large compila-
tion, from various sources, of references to other authors, classical
and eeclesiastical, some given as quotations, but most by reference
to the places in which the passages are to be found. 'Phe object of
this is said to be “ tc rescue certain authors from undeserved con·
tampt.” The authors meant are those later than the Augustan
age. Whether they are held in undeserved contempt, or whether
this commentar-y has helped to rescue them, I do not know. Mr.
Mayor does not approve of Heinrich, and from the nature of his
own commentary it was not to be expected that he would. His
text professes to be that of Jahn, “except in orthography and
-pnnotuation.” In his interpretation when he has an opportunity
he follows the judgment of Madvig, in whose Opuscula there are
two essays in which some passages of Juvenal are commented upon.
With all respect for that eminent scholar, I do not think the interss
pretation of Juvenal was quite in his way. Ihave mentioned his
opinion in several places. The names of Grangaeus, Britannicus,
Henninius, and other scholars of the sixteenth and seventeenth
centurias, will be found in these notes Their commentaries, in
part or entire, are collected in a thick quarto volume, published at
heyden by Herminius in 1695, which book Ruperti calls “ indi·
gestam vanae speciosaeque doctrinae farraginem, rudemque rernm
inutilium molem? It contains much that is wrong and a great deal
that is good, and Ruperti need not have despised it. 'l'he edition of
Lubinus (Hanover,1603) Ι have had by me. Ruperti looks upon
him as “verbosus nugator.” He was a learned man and the friend
of learned men, and often understood Juvenal where Ruperti did not.
