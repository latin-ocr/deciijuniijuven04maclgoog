SATIRA XIV.

INTRODUCTION.

Trns satira contains some golden rules and is throughout written iu Juvenal’s beat
style. It exposesone of the radioal causa of the prevailiug immorality, which was tho
contagious example and bad teachiug of parents, acting from their earliest years upon
their children. Inavicioushome nothing hut vice can he learnt: the sin of the father
is visited upon theson because the son contracta aud exaggeratas the father’s vices: the
gamoster begets gamesters; the lieentious heget profligatos 3 the spendthrith is the
father of spendthritts and the miser of misers3 partly from the force of infectiou aud
partly baanae teaching cannot aa a general rulo riso above practice, and he who paradeo
hisfaults before his child cannot even reprove that child if he adopts thern. There is
not a mors pregnant sentence iu any author than that, “Maxima debetur pueris
reverentia.’' Itis a truth which the better instincts of mankind at once acknowledge,
and it could not have been better expressed or supported iu more dignificd languaga
than Juvenal has here used. It would have been pleasant if hisexperience or the scope
οι· his satire had admitted of his drawing a pictura of a homa in which vhtua grows
by the same means aa vice grows hy in others, and showing us how domestic example
and the influenee of a happy home aot on the characters of men and the well-being of -
society.

The inherited vices J uvenal speaks of are gaming, luxurians living, violence of temper,
contempt for iuferiors, semnnhty, extravagance, superstition, and avariae. The greater
part of the satire is taken up with the last, and the love of getting, for the salre of
having or for· display, is traced from its earliest impression on the young mind, ιο which
in general itis not natural, through injustice, selfishness, crime, and danger, to the
miserahle arrxiety that waits upon possession atter all has been done to secure it. Once
only he touches shortly on the influence of mothers' example on their daughters. There
isas might beexpecteda reference to the simplicity of the oldentime, andthere are one
or two pictores, as of the anxious host (v. 59, sqq.) and the soldier's family (166, sqq.)
such as Juvenal siretches with peculiar power.

ARGUMENT.

There's many au act of foul report, Fuscinus, leaving its stain for ever on young minds,
which parents teach their children both by precept and example. The old man
gamas, his boy too shakes the dice. What hope is there of him who learns in youth
to reason lig-peckers and mushrooms, taught hy his father? Give him a thou·
