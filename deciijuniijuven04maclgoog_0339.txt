for him, the haunting presence of the liar's gnilt spoiling his meals‚ severing his blood,
disturbing his sicep, adding terror 10110 thunder and despair to 01010000, hinderinghis
prayers and standing for ever between himself and the gods he has offendet. Nosearoi
his repentiug: nature will be too strong for him, and will go back tc the guiltthat oon·
science has condemncd3 and so he will go from sin 10 remense, and back again to sin,
till at last he will be caught in his own snare, and comete the punishment ofthe 10100,

The satire takes the form 01 expostulation and ironical consolation throughout. 11 'u
Ἰ most familiarly known as dealing with the subject osan accusing conscience, which itdoss
10 avery powerful way from v. 192 to 235. But this is only oue part 01 the whole. 'lhe
character 01110 times and thecontrast of the past and present occupy much 01 thepocm,
and there isa very flue passage describingthe way in which men temper with guiltaud
argue themselves into the commission of it, aud put on a bold 1000 as 01 innoceuce, from
1. 86 10 119.

(iiffcrd says, “Juvenal is here almost aChristian;'' and he speaks 01110 doctrines con·
tained in this satire “as cf such pure, such sublime morality'' as “the light 01 natura
alone was incapable 01 discovering ; and which the author undoubtedly derived from that
‘true light’ which now began to glimmer through the Roman world,'’ and more 10 thot
effect, Ι have made a remark on this subject in oue of the notes (v. 209). But foethe
chronological difficulty there are many who would seythatttbe same light glimmeredin
110 mind of Socrates, whose views 01110 super-vision 01 (lod aud the power 01 conscience
were not less clear than Juvenal's‚ though we have no such powerful exposition 01 his
ideas as we have here. There never was a time when conscience did not exist in 110

. mind 01 man, however completely the habit 01 guiit may have secred it 10 00ωο and have

givenacolour 01 iunocenceto wickedness iu the judgment of wholecommuuities. What
Juvenal says ou the subject of conscience derives its only weight from its truth3 and
though he exaggerates when he leads to the inference that the atinga 010 guilty conscience
must necessarily follow gnilt, the picture he drawa 10 taken from experience, not hom
revelation, the experience 01 those who were 00 Christiane and had no knowledge to
frighten them but that which was suggested from within. The soliloquy (v. 92-105)10
which aman argues away the misgivings with which he enters upon crime cr the denial 01
it, represents οο (10011 110 conduct and feelings 01 many whohave more light than thatof
conscience ; but there 100 the man is not a bad Christian, bnt a bad pagan ; and if we arc
surprised 10 read in Juvenal language or sentimenta which if delivered from a Christian
pulpit wouldbe appropriate and searching, it isbecause we are apt to forget that human
nature, wlth its desires, its corruptions, and its sels-deceptione, bas always been the same
10 110 main,and that (iod has never 1000 without hiswitness against guilt in the bear-toi
man. That rovenge 10 unphilosophical aud vindictiveness the proci 01 0 little mind may
be affirmcd without more light than man has always possessed. But this doctrineinpnrg
’ ticular it 10 01 which Gilsord declares that “neither Thales nor Chrysippus, no, nor his
grentmaster Zeno ever taught or even conceived '' 11. How does heknow 11101 Hedoes
001 add that Socrates did not 001 upon it, as Juvenal (who does 001 look tn Christianity
’ for his examples) says he was ready to do. And if he acted the doctrine 10 preachad
it, as, if Pluto is 10 10 trusted, ,he equally did in words ε cr 1110 did not Plato did it for
him, and that comestothc same thing. '

’110 sum of this is that the reader had better take up this satire aa representing tha
common moral sense 01 mankind, und look to the law of Christianity aa confirmiugtba
unwritten law 01 which conscience hes always been the guardian aud theexponent, and
of which such writiugs as J uvenal’s‚ especially this poem, arethe clear-est evidence.
