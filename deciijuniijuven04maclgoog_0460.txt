Seriolae veterem metucns deradere limum
Ingemit, ‘Hoc bene sit l’ tunicatum cum sale mordens 30
Caepe et, farratam pueris plaudentibus ollam,
Pannosam faecem morientis sorbet aceti ?'’
At si unctus cesses et figas incute solem,
Est prope te ignotus cubito qui tangat, et acre
Despuat in mores, penemque arcanaque lumbi 3⁵
Runcautem populo metuentes pandere vtrlvas:
“Tu cum maxillis balanatum gausape pectas,
Inguinibus quare detonsus gurgulio extat?
Quinque palaestritae licet haec plantaria vellant,
Elixasque nates labefactent forcipe adunca, 40
Non tamen ista filix ullo mansuescit aratro.”
