SATIRA XIII. 309

Ingenium dulcique senex vicinus Hymetto, 185

Qui partem acceptae saeva inter vincla cicutae

Accusatori nollet dare. Plurima felix

Paullatim vitia atque errores exuit omnes,

Prima docet rectum Sapientia3 quippe minuti
· Semper et infirmi est animi exiguique voluptas 190

Ultio ; continuo sic collige, quod vindicta

Nemo magis gaudet quam femina. Cur tamen hos tu

Evasisee putee quos diri conscia iacti

Mens habet attonitos et surdo verbere caedit,

Occultum quatiente animo tortore flagellum? ιιι

Poena autem vehemens ac multo saevior illis,

Quas et Caedicius gravis invenit aut Rhadamanthus,

Nocte dieque suum gestare in pectore testem.
