among 001 And theu he wenta a wife 01 the old stamp! Bleed him, ye doctore
A pretty fellow! Go give a 0011 10 111110 if your 11110 10 chame: there are but few
can touch the crowns 01 Ceres, few whom their fathers would not loathe to 11100
Well, go and wreathe the flowers about your door; your wife will with one husband
be content,-nay sooner with one eye. We've heard, to be sure, 01 0110 who lived
010010 at her father's country-place. But lether live so in the country-town: orl
grant you at her father²s seat3 but who can tell what goes on there? Are Jupiter
and Mars so old?

V. 60. In all the porticoes and theatres can you see one whom it were 001010 wed? See
how they melt at the lascivious dance, and catch each sigh and learn it! Others

when theatres are closed get up their private plays. One likes thefaroe player,
one the comio, one the tragic actor, another spoils the singer’s voice. What, do you
think any would love Quintilian? Yon marry that musicians may beget your
children, or your babe may show the face 01 110 mirmillo in his own. Hippia, the ,
senator’s wife, went off to Egypt witha player ; and e'en Canopus cried shame on our

11101010. Forgetful of her home, the wretch, and country, her sponse, her sister, and
her sous, yea even games and Paris she abandoned Nurtured 111 luxury, she
despised the sea; her character she had despised before-a trifling 1000 among these
melting dames. Yes, she bore the dangers 01 so many 0000 3 but when 'tis duty calls
them, then they tremble. They're hold enough for sin, butif their husbands bid them
go on board, 'tis hard; such nasty smells, they're siok, the 011100 go round—their
stomach's strong enough when 'tis their paramours they follow. One 10111110 on her
husband, while the other dines with the sailors, vanders about the deck, and pulls
the ropes. What was it charmed our Hippia so, that she could bear to be ealled a
player’s wife? Sergiolus was uo boy, his 1000 was ugly, his 10101001100011011, a ven
upon his noso, his eye 101 0101 dropping. But he was a gladiator3 this was his
beauty, 'twas for this she gave up all. They love the steel: let Sergius take the rudis
and he's no better than her husband.

V. 111. Why care for private houses? Look at the rivals 01 our gods, and hear what ¹
Claudius hed to bear. His strumpet wife stole from his hed, covered her head, and
with one slave girl went and took her stand by the brothel door, exposed her person,
told her price, and took whoever came, sad only when the time came round that she
must go.

V. 133. Why should I speah 01 charms, philtres, and poisoned step-children? When
their sex’s medness drives them, lust is their 0111011001 10011.

V. 136. But why's Caesennia virtuous, by her husband's showing? She brought him a
round sum, that’s what his testimouy's worth: ’twas not the bow or torch 01 1010 that
won him, her money is the torch, her dos the 0110110. Ηο buys what liberty he 10ος
110 greedy men's rich wife is as a maid ; before his 1000 010 nods and writes 10 101
10101. Why does Sertorius 1010 Bibula? Because she's pretty. Three wrinlrles,a
blech tooth, 0 drier skin, and then, “Paelr up your boggage and begoue,’' he cries;

“ l’m tired 01 you, besides you wipo your nose. 01 with yon! there's another coming
with dry nose.’' Till then she’s a hot tyrant ς aslis 101 110 1111001 110010 and wines-
nay that's but little-whole prisone full 01 slaves. Whetever’s to be had she buys; l
goes to the fair, takes up the 1111001 crystals, porcelain, diamonds, such as Agrippa

ve his 010101.

1181161. But 01 00 many is there not 0110 good? Iret her have beauty, grace, wealth, 1
fertile womb, ancestors, ehastity; beshe 0 bird aa rare asablaclr swan, who could endure l
a wife with every virtue? Ι had rather, yea I’d rather have a country girl than the
mother 01 the Gracchi, 11 with her grem virtues she's to bringa pride as great, and
count her triumphs in her portion: away with Hannibale and Syphaxes, and all your ¹
Carthago put together. “ Spare my boys, Paean, spere, Diana3 slay their mother, 101
