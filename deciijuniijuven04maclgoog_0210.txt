SATIRA VII.

INTRODUO'I'ION.

'l'ms satire turns on tuo neglect of literar-y men by the rich. Poets are left ιο star-ve or
get their broad by menial callings3 historiam are no better 0ff; lawyers and school·
masters are put off with the shabbiest fees, and men will spond their money on any thing
rather thw their sons’ education. Thu is the most forcible and instructive part of the
satire, which dasenbes the woary taslr of the schoolmnstsr, the little return of gratitudo
he gets, and the exactingdemands of parents who expect every thing and will pay little
or nothing. The toacher who in the good old times, Juvenal says, was meatod with pro·
found respect, in hia day was insulted by parents and therefore by pupils. If the boyis
ahlockth and cannot learn the master gets all the blame.

.“ — culpa docentis
Scilicet arguitur si laeva in parte mamillae ι ’
rm salit hodio juveni.'’ (vii. 158.)
'l'he only patron learned men have, says J uvenal, is the emperor, and it has been much
questioned which emperor it could have been. The statement is most in accordance with
what we hear of the reign of Hadrian, during which he managed ιο encomsge ιΙιο arts

and literature atRome, though he was absent the greater part of his time. The subject
is dhcrrssm in the Life of Juvenal, ιο which the reader is referred. '

ARGUMENT.

The hope and purpose cf our studies is iu Caesm only. He only cares for the
Muses in these times when poeta leave the veles of Helicon aud live by baths, by
bahing, auctioneering. For if Pieriau woods won’t give you bread, you must e’cn ply
the crier's trade in the Atria. And this is better than ιο lie in the oourts, though
knights of Asia aud BiHynia do it. ,

V. 16-35. But this is past; no poet now shall be degraded to do dirtywork. Up and
bestir yourselves, my friends ς the prince is secking whom he may reward. If you
sre waiting for another patron, go put your books in the tire or leave them to the
worma: go break your pens aud wipe out all your lines ς the rich have learnt to
admira and praise you, as children do the peaoock. But the useful years of life are
passing, and when old age comes on with weariness and poverty, it hstes itself and
its own Muse.

V. 86-47. 'l'hisis the way the man you worship, leaving ibe Muses and Apollo’s temple,
contrives to give you nothing. Being himself a poet (eqnal to Homer save in years),
if you're ambitione to recita your poenas he lenda you a dirty room a long way off,
bolted for years ae safe as the gates of a beleaguered town: he sends his freedmeu to
applaud3 but he'll not give as much as the benches cost to hire. .

V. 48-97. And yet we go on atthis work, ploughing the sends laboriously. If you
should give it up, the old habit pulls you back3 for with too many the itch of writing
is incurahle and goes on to old age in their weary hesrts. But a rare poet, noue of
your common sort, suc'h asI only can conceive not name, is made so by a careless
mind, free from all bitterness, loving tho woods and Muses' springs. 'Tis not for
poverty to sing in caves and wield the thyrsus. Horatius was full when he cried
lluoe! What room for genius if other cares than his own verse disturb the poet's
