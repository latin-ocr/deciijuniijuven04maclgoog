V. 13. We all must write, one verse, another prose. Such is thetrash that, combed and
ringed, with leering eye, a man will spout before the people, tickling their wauton
blood. What you, old wretch, purrey such food lor strangers' ears, that they may

V. 44. If erer by a lucky chance I write a tolerable thing or two, I refusa not praise;
my liver is not hard. All I deny iethet the end of lire and limit of all good is that

Some newa-days like Accius and Pacuvius ς and? when ¹blind fathers teach their

morning lounge aud asternoon debauchery.
