He wanted ten days to complete bis twenty-eighth year. A pamgraph
in the memoir, which is from a later hand than the first part, says he
died of a disease of the stomach. This is probably an invention, and
there is no other evidence of the cause of his death. From the company
he kept, his political feelings must have been well known, and had he
lived longer he might have shared the fate of his most intimate friends,
of whom Thrasea, Seneca, Lucanus, were put to death, and Cornutus
was banished.

He left behind him, besides the productione of his early years above

referred to, nemore than the six Satires in this book ⁸, the last of which,
¹ as appears plain to me from the ending, as well as from the obvious
meaning of the Grammarian's words, he must have left untinished.
These he probablyhad communicated only te his intimate friends during
his life; but after his death, Cornutus, whom he probably left his
executor, having slightly revised the Satires, gave them to Caesius Bassus
at his (Bassus’) request, to edit. Attempts have been made to trace the
corrections of Cornutus, one of those tasks that certain understandings
delight iu. The famous line noticed by the Grammarian (S. i. 121)
may very well have been written by Persius, as he says; and though his
editor could not have published it without bringing disgraee and per-
haps destruction on himself, and the alteration may therefore be excused,
the verse cannot be said to have been mended by the substitution of the
words that now form part of the text. When the volume was published
it immediately attracted attention, and was much read and admired.
Since Horace no one of any ability had put forth writings of this kind,
and in these Satires there was found much to remind the public of their
favourite poet, combined with a great deal of originality and genius.
Persius’ intimate acquaintance with Horace's poems appears in a great
number of passages, most of which show that unconseious imitation
which is the surest sign of the minute study of an author. Casaubon
has collected a large number of parallel passages from the two authors,
some of which may perhaps be a little strained. ⁴

Persius is said by his biographer to have been slow in composition.
This is very likely. His verse does not flow in a rapid and muddy
stream like that of Lucilius, as Horace describes him (S. i. 4), but as
he says himself “caedit pluteum et demorsos sapit ungues'' (S. i. 106).
He has evidently taken Horace’s advice (S. i. 10. 69, sqq.) too literally‚
and corrected himself till his language has become short and th'e ideas
condensed, to a degree that makes the sense in some places obscure.
Modern readers have found great fault with the poet on this account.
But I think the obscurity has been exaggerated, and that, except

³ See not 5.
