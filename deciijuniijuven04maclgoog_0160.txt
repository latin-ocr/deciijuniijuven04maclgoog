The tyranny in onrhonses is worse than palaces of Sicily. If one has mode an assig-
netion aud would dress 111010 bandsonrely then common, in haste to meet 1101 lover in
the gardeus or at lsis' shrine, poor Psecas has to dress her hair, with her own torn,
her tunic too in rega her breast exposed. “This cnrl's too high !'' the lssh evenges
straight the crime. But what has Psecas done? She cannot help your ugly noso.
Another manages the other side: and then 1110 old woman is called in who once was
elever at 1110 crisping pin, bnt now is sent to mind the spinning. They give their
judgments esch in turn, as if her fame or life were now at stoke. Such care for looks! '
so many stories high she builds her head, Andromache before but short behind. What
0011 a woman do whom nature mede apygmy?

V. 508. Her husband all the while she thinks no more of than a neighbour‚ aud is no
more, except as she hstes his friends and slaves and sponde his money. Look at that
linge eunuch priest, bow bo eomes into her 100111, with solemn talk frightens and
bids her buy off auturnn's ills with a hundred eggs, and give 1101 clothes to him, that
‚all her fears and dangers may go with them. She’ll stand in 1110 eold iiber, crawl slong
the Campus if Io bids her. She'll go to Egypt ond fetcb hely water to sprinkle lsis'
shrine, thinking she hears the goddess' self command her (the gods to talk by night
with such as thesei). 'ihs highest reverenee is psid to him who runs about the 101111
wit-h Anubis' head, and laughs st the erowds that best their breests. He asks his
grace for each offending dame, and the snake shakes its head. Moved by his tesrs
and groans Osiris perdens, bribed with a goose ond biscuit.

V. 542. »Theo goes the J ewish hag, the priestess of 1110 grove, the messenger of heaven,
and gets her foe. For a mere trifle Jews will sell yon dreems.

V. 548. Tho haruspex from the East pmmises wenlth and lovers, first sesrehing entrails,
bearis of dores, or dogs, 01 chickens, sometimes even boys, and then he turns
informer.

V. 553. Chaldaeans ere more trusted still. Whate’er the astrologers may say must be
divine. The first of these is he who, banishedoft, was fatal with his hireliug books to
Galba. His exile was his strength; the astrologer’s believed only if he has worked in
chains, been long iu prison, 01· has been transported and just saved his life. 'l'hese
yper wife consults about her mother’s death, but first about your own, and when her
sisters shall be buried, and her uncle; or if her lover shall survive herself: what
greater boon ean gods bestow 1

V. 569. But she is not so bad who knows not of herself the induence of the stare, and
times, nnd sessons. But shun that women in whose hand yon see thumbed almanacks
who wants no man's advice, but gives advice herself. She'll 1101 go sbroad with 1101
husband if the book says no; consults it ere she drives to the first milestone, anoints
her eyes by 1110 horoscope, takes no food when sick but st the honr prescribed. Or if
she's poor she goes to the Circus. The rich keep their augur, or they fec the public

one; the humble strumpet goes 10 the pillars, 0111111010 asks ifshe shall wed the slop-
seller andjilt the victualler.

V. 592. But these bear children, sye, and nurse them too: children are never born on
go'lded betis, bnt eut off in the womb. Be glsd thou wretch and give the draught
thyselfi so shalt thou not be father to sn Aethiop, nor have an heir whom thou would’st
shnn to 111001 in the early morning. ,

V. 602. Then the supposititious breta, the joys aud vows 01 s fond father cheated et the
wells, and priests and nobles got from that foul quarter 1 10110110 stands there and
smiles, and folds the babies in her bosom, then lsughing gives them to great houses aud
properes a private faree for herself: these are the 111011 she loves, and rears as her own
foster children.
