LIFE. 01¹ J UVENAL. xvii

away, for it was written shortly after the consulship of Juniue, and
therefore, if Sabinus be the man, in the middle or towards the beginning
of Domitian’s reign. But it will be shown below that the banishment
could not have happened till late in Domitian's reign, and Ι believe
Hadrian’s consul, Junius Rusticus, 10 meant, and that the Satira was
written early in Hadriau's reign, that is about 00. 121, or two years
after the consulship of J unius ⁸.

In Sat. xiii. 17 he speaks of Calvinus, the friend he addresses, as
then sixty years old‚aud bomin the consulship of Fonteius. I think
it almost certain that the consul referred to is L. Fonteius Capito, cos.
00. 59, and that therefore the Satire was written towards tho be*
ginning 01 Hadrian’s reign, aud not earlier than au. 119.

3 v‚The earlier date to which Lipsius and others refer it, as stated in my ’
0010 (xiii. 17), 10 1001000000Α years before the reign of Hadrian. .
Either, therefore, Juvenal did not write at all in that reign, or this
Satira was written while Hadrian was emperor, about an. 119.
Otherwise Juvenal’s Satires must range over a period of fifty years or
thereabouts, and one of the very best must have been nearly the earliest.
Those who arc of opinion that the allusion to Meroe in v. 163 01 this
Satira, resulted from personal observation, must be prepared to admit
the later date, orto suppose that the banishment of Juvenal to Egypt
by Domitian 10 altogether fabulous, and that his visit to that country
must have been early in the reign of Vespasian, if not before it, since
the Satira, according to the other hypothesis, must have been written
about the fourth year of that reign, and nine years before Domitian
became emperor.

Thus the sixth‚ seventh, thirteenth‚ and fifteenth Satires have internal
evidenoes by which they may be referred to the reign of Hadrian, and
of .these the three last, Ι have no ddubt, were written under that*
emperor. · ,
Βο1 11 we take nn. 120 as the latest'date of which there is evidence,
how far back may we go to determine the author’s age?

It is nearly certain that the first Satira was written in Trajan’s reign,
not long after the banishment 01 Marius Priscus, 00). 100.

The reference to war on the Euphrates in the eighth Satire (v. 51)
makes it probable that the poem was written during the Armenian and
Parthian wars (0.0. 114-116), 10 the course of which (0.0. 115)

⁸ Ruperti, I think, 10 right in aaying “Satira xv. hoo ³forto anno scripta (121). non
superiore, nam si tam recens factum 00001 quod in ea narrat, poeta opinor v. 27 simpli-
citer dixisset ‘nuper’ neque adjecisset ‘Consule Junio ⁹ '³ (Vita Juv. per annos digesta,
vol. i. p. xxx). This commentator thinks that Juvenal, now in his eighty-first year, was
suspected 01 having written Satira vii. against Hadrian, and was banished by him.
Poor old man! ’
