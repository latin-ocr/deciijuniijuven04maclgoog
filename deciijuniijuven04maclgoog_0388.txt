SATIRA XIV. 339

Aestivum tona .” Infelix hae forsitan ipsa 105

Obrutus et zonam laeva morsuque tenebit.
Sed eujus votis modo non suflboerat aurum
Quod Tagus et rutila volvit Pactolus arena,
Frigida sufficient velantes inguina panni
Exiguusque oibus, mersa rate naufragus assem
Dum rogat et pieta se tempestate tuetur.
· Tantis parta malis eura majore metuque
Servantur. Misera est magni custodia census.
Dispositis praedives hamis vigilare eohortem
Servorum noctu Licinus jubet, attonitus pro

Atque ¹ebore et lata testudine. Dolia nudi
Non ardent Cynici: si fregeris, altera liet
