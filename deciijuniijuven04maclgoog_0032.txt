mun OF PERSIUS. xxvii

Annaeus Cornutus, a philosopher ‘of tho Stoic school, to which most
men of thought at that time belonged. To Cornutus he became much
attached, and the fiiendship continued to the end of his life. His obli·
gations to this excellent man he feelingly acknowlcdges in the fifth
satire. While he was at school 'he appears to have written a comedy3
also a poem, probably of a humonous cast, which he called Ὀδοιπορικά,
Wayside Veraes, or The Traveller, or whatever it may have been, and
some verses on the death cf his kinewoman Arria. she was the wife of
Caecina Paetus, who for treason was put to death by Claudius. The
allusion in the life is to her conduct on this occasion. Paetus was
required to be his own executiones. His wife, who loved him devotedly
and had declared she would die with him, took a dagger, stabbed herself,
drew it cut, and handed it to her husband, and said, “Paetus it is not
pcinful ⁵.'' This happened sn). 42, before Persius was eight years old.
These carly productione his motherkept till her death, and then, by the
judicious educe of Cornutus, deshuyed them. '
How soon after his father's death his mother married again, itis im-

possible to say. But that she remained with her two children, Aulus
and his sister, at Volaterrae, till the boy was old enough to gc to Rome,
and that she continued to superintend his educatien till he went to
Cornutus, may be assumedss 'The Scholiast, on S. vi 6, says that after ⁴
the death of her first husband she married in Liguria, where Persius was
staying when that Satira was written. It is more likely that she retired
to this ,part of the country, to a house left her by her second husband,
after his death, leaving hersen to pursue his studies under the guidanoe
and roof of Cornutus ⁰. ’

’ At this time he formed an intimate acquaintance with that Caesius
Bassus to whom the last Satine is addressed, and with Calpurnius Sura,
of whom however we know nothing more than the Grammarn'an tells us,
that he died young, and thet Persius survived him.

⁶ See Pliny, Epp. iii. 16. Martial (i. 14) has sn epigram cn this event:

“ Casta suo gladium cum traderet Arria Paeto,
Quem de visceribus traxerat ipsa suis,

‹si qua fides vulnus quod feci non dolct‚’ inquis,
‘Sed quod tu facies hoc mihi, Paete, dolet? e

⁸ lium Persius' way of speaking of Lunae Portus it has been supposed by some that
hswas born there. But independently of the express testimony of the Grammarian, ·
there ispresumptive evidence in the name of Sisennia, which is Etrurian, aud in Arria
his kinswcman having marricd'ancina, whose family were natives of Volaterrae, to con·
firm the statement that Persius was born there. There is of course no weight to be
attachcdto the tradition which is mentioned only, as far as I knovv, in Baylc's notice of
Persius in his Dictionury, that a modern family of Volterra (the Falconcini) are derived
fron Persius' father, who had bnt one son, and he died unmarried. From the same
source I leam thatahouse was shown a century ag'o at Volterra as that of Persius.
