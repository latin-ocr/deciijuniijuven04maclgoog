140 D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Ut spectet ludos conducit Ogulnia vestem,
Conducit comites, sellam, cervical, amicas,
Nutricem, et flavam cui det mandata puellam.
Haec tamen argenti superest quodcunque paterni 355
Levibus athletis ac vasa novissima donat.
Multis res angusta domi est: sed nulla pudorem
Paupertatis habet, nec se metitur ad illum
Quem dedit haee posuitque modum. Tamen utile quid sit
Prospiciunt aliquando viri, frigusque famemque 360
Formica tandem quidam expavere magistra.
Prodiga non sentit pereuntem femina censum,
At velut exhausta redivivuspullulet arca
Nummus et e pleno tollatur semper acervo,
Non unquam reputant quanti sibi gaudia constent. 365

- Summa tamen, quod jam calida matura juventa
Inguina traduntur medicis, jam pectine nigro. 370
Ergo spectatos ac jussos crescere primum
Testieulos, postquam coeperunt esse bilibres,
Tonsoris damno tantum rapit Heliodorus
Conspicuus longe cunctisque notabilis intrat
